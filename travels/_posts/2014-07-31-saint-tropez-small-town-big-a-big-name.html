            Saint-Tropez used to be a small fishing town, but since Brigitte Bardot in the 1950, it's become the playground of the jet set.
            I didn't really like it. It's a nice little town, but there's plenty others like it around here.

            To be fair: we don't own a yacht to show off, and we didn't go partying - 2 of the main reasons to come to Saint-Tropez.

            There's little reason to come to Saint-Tropez by car, as most of the streets are too narrow to drive through.
            Coming from pretty much every major town in the area, you'll reach Sainte-Maxime faster, from where you can take the ferry to Saint-Tropez.
            We were lucky to be in Sainte-Maxime on a Thursday morning, for the farmers market.
            The ferry will bring you to the harbor, which is probably Saint-Tropez's main attraction.
            It's filled with the most expensive yachts and the quay is lined with restaurants, bars and tourist shops.

            Head inland, into the little town, and there'll be a lot less going on.
            The village is picturesque and you can go play a game of pétanque on the Place Des Lices, but that's about it.
            Or head up to the Citadelle and enjoy the naval museum in there. Or the view from up here.

            But that's about it. There's just not too much to do in Saint-Tropez.
            Granted, we didn't go to Saint-Tropez's most famous beach: Pampelonne beach.
            It's about 5km from the Saint-Tropez harbor, and it's where all the night clubs are.
            We had to leave in the evening, so I've no idea what the party scene is like. I wonder if it lives up to its reputation.
