    My girlfriend is a big fan of Christmas & the holiday spirit, but we didn't have vacation until after Christmas.
    What better place to enjoy the remaining Christmas lights in the City of Light, right? Wrong!

        My girlfriend is a big fan of Christmas & the holiday spirit, but we didn't have vacation until after Christmas.
        What better place to enjoy the remaining Christmas lights in the City of Light, right?

        <strong>Wrong!</strong>

        There's plenty to do in Paris in the festive season, though.
        There are more than a dozen Christmas markets scattered throughout the French capital, where you can buy your Christmas decorations, arts & crafts, or simply enjoy a Raclette dish with a glass of Glühwein.
        There are a couple of ice skating rinks, including one on the Eiffel Tower's first floor (though not this year.)
        And there's Christmas decoration and lights everywhere, making this city even more romantic.
        But it sure didn't take the French long to tear down their Christmas decorations: there wasn't much left when we got there, on December 27.

        After spending most of the day wandering around Paris without coming across Christmas markets, we figured we'd head back to La Défense, the modern business district located at the western end of the Historical Axis of Paris.
        We figured the business district wouldn't be too busy in the week between Christmas & New Year's, and we'd score a good hotel rate here at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/citizenm-paris-la-defense.html?aid=1286294&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1">citizenM</a>.
        We had seen there was still a Christmas market here, a pretty big one, while we were walking towards the metro station on our way to the historic center.
        But when we got back, we learned that this was the last day for this market, and it had just closed.
        We quickly got back on the metro towards Montmartre, where we exited the station just in time to overhear one of the vendors trying to sell his last food before closing up.
        Oh well!

        We ended up relearning the importance of doing at least some minor research before going on holiday.
        But that's alright - Paris has enough to offer!
