            Whenever I travel, I get so excited &amp; I usually start making plans way ahead of time.
            But not this time, for my trip to Montreal.
            Not that I didn't look forward to it, but I left the day after getting back from our vacation to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travels/explore-south-africa/">South Africa</a>, and planning that road trip had occupied most of my free time.
            But even though I was only there for a few days and hadn't made any plans, this city didn't disappoint.
            Some of the best experiences come unexpected, I guess!

            Montreal is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest city in Canada and the 4<sup>th</sup> largest French-speaking city in the world (behind Paris, Kinshasa & Abidjan.)
            But if your French is bad, you'll have nothing to worry about as long as you speak English.
            I didn't really know anything about Montreal except that it gets really cold in winter, with a lot of snow.
            But this was summer, and weather was amazing!

            Thank God it was, because a friend of mine who lives there always told me that this is a city that needs to be experienced on foot.
            I never really quite understood what he meant by that, but I believe I do now.
            Public transportation is good - with a decent metro &amp; bus network - but there's a lot to be seen in a relatively small area.

            To be fair, I haven't exactly explored all of Montreal.
            I stayed at <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/le-centre-sheraton-montreal-quebec.html?aid=1286294&no_rooms=1&group_adults=1">Le Centre Sheraton Montreal Hotel</a>, right in the middle of Montreal's downtown area.
            I was only here for a few days and spent just about all of my time in downtown and the Old Town/Old Port.

            Founded in 1642, it's one of the older North-American cities and it still shows: in between the skyscrapers and the more modern landmarks that were built for the 1967 Expo &amp; 1976 Olympics, are a ton of old buildings that scream the grandeur of the French colonial empire and the height of the British empire.
            Well, old&hellip; You won't find buildings as old as you could see in Europe.
            But relative to most other North American cities, there sure is a lot.

            But there's more to Montreal, and that American-European blend is magical.
            Shopping is fun and easy in the many malls and big-brand stores in and around the Rue Sainte-Catherine, while the abundance of small bars and bistros make it very cozy.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few blocks north-east of Rue Sainte-Catherine is Mont Royal, the hill that gave the city its name.
            The eastern half of that hill is now a park: Parc du Mont Royal, designed by the same architect who did <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/">New York</a>'s <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/#central-park">Central Park</a>.
            If you like a nice walk or jog, this is the place to go: it's a 6 km (~ 3.5 mi) round-trip trail to the top of the park, where a stunning view of the Montreal skyline awaits you at the Mount Royal Belvedere.
            Or extend that jog with a few kilometers if you want to see some more of the park, like the Lac aux Castors or the Mount Royal Cross.
