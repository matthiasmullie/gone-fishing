title: Living it up in Monaco
description: >
    Monaco is a sovereign state and it shares a border only with France and the Mediterranean.
    It's very small: it'd be the smallest state of the world, were it not for the Vatican.
    Because there is no income tax, Monaco's considered a tax haven.

            In a previous post, I said I'd pick <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travels/what-to-do-in-nice/">Nice</a> if I had to choose a place to live in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tag/côte-d-azur/">French Riviera</a>.
            Actually, I'd prefer Monaco even more, because that would mean I'd be wealthy beyond belief.
            Property prices are through the roof here, with the average real estate agency selling apartments anywhere in the range of 1 to 20 million euros.

            Way beyond anything I'd ever be able to afford!

            Monaco is a sovereign state and it shares a border only with France. And the Mediterranean.
            It's very small: measuring only 2 km&sup2;; (0.78 mi&sup2;).
            Were it not for the Vatican, it'd be the smallest state of the world.
            Because there is no income tax, Monaco's considered a tax haven.
            I guess that'll help if you want to buy or rent something there!

            But it's a pretty little state. Because it's so small, you don't need more than a day to take it all in.
            Heck, it only takes Formula 1 drivers under 1:20 to complete a lap of Monaco!
            Because of the differences in altitude, Monaco can be confusing to navigate and a demanding walk.
            Especially around the Jardin Exotique, Monaco's biggest garden filled with rare &amp; diverse plants.
            I'd suggest to visit it starting at the top and going down.
            When you want to come back up later, you can just take the free public elevators.

            Monte Carlo, north-east of the port, is the most populous district and it's also where you'll find the famed Monte Carlo Casino, the Opera House, and where you'll find all the high end fashion.
            If you've got money to spend, this is where you'll want to be!
            Shopping in Monaco is expensive, but the prices in restaurants were alright, not too extravagant.
            They were comparable to other places in the Riviera, which is not really <q>cheap</q>.

            At the bottom of the gardens is La Condamine, where you'll find the port with yachts the size of houses.
            South of the port is the old city, nicknamed <q>Le Rocher</q> (<q>The Rock</q>) for obvious reasons.
            This old fortress-turned-palace is where Albert II, Prince of Monaco, has his humble residence.
            Be there at noon to see the changing of the guards.
            The rest of the rock is mostly stuck in time: it's still a medieval village made up of narrow streets and houses older than anyone who still lives there.
