            After our visit to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}stories/is-there-more-to-cannes-than-the-film-festival/">Cannes</a>, Nice was the next stop on our French Riviera tour.
            We only had a day to spend there, and I really wished we'd had more time.

            If I had to pick a city along the French Riviera to live in, Nice would be the one.
            It's a pretty big, vibrant city that has much more going on than just tourism.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Avenue Jean Médecin is the city's artery &amp; main shopping street.
            It's a mostly pedestrian street - except for the tramway - running from the train station in the north to the Place Masséna, the city's main square, in the south.
            From there, it's only a short walk to the Promenade des Anglais, which runs perpendicular to <q>The Avenue</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Promenade des Anglais is where it's at for that postcard view of the Nice coastline.
            It runs along the coast for about 5km (3mi) and it's where the cyclists arrive at the end of the Paris-Nice cycling tour.
            And while you can go to the beach - and many do - there are better options in the area: Nice's beaches consist of stones rather than sand, making them less comfortable to walk or lay on.

            East of the Promenade des Anglais &amp; Place Masséna is the charming old town, full of eateries and an interesting market: the Marché aux Fleurs.
            Further east is the Mont Boron hill, where you'll find some of the best views of Nice.
            Keep going, just a little further, to overlook Cap Ferrat, a peninsula on the other side of the hill.
            Or just keep going in that same direction, along the coastline, towards Monaco (about 30 minutes east of Nice): it's a very scenic route where you may want to consider a quick stop at Èze, a small village on a mountain, for an even higher vantage point.
