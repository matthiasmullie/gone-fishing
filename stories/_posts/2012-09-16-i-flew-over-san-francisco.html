            On my trip to San Francisco, I got the chance to fly a Cessna over San Francisco <strong>by myself</strong>.
            After about half an hour on the flight simulator, to get acquainted with some controls, we went out, inspected the plane, and I soon found myself a mile above San Francisco.
            And the Golden Gate bridge. And Alcatraz.

            Victor, the instructor, sat next to me to take care of all the hard work - like talking to the control tower and landing - but I actually took off and flew this thing myself!
            I probably wouldn't have been allowed to fly on an overcast day - I don't know how to read most of the instruments - but weather conditions were perfect.

            I realize this may not be for everyone. If you're scared of flying, I'm sure this'll sound like a nightmare.
            As I said before: conditions were perfect, and I didn't have to worry about all the hard parts of flying, but still: I feel like I have a bit more of an understanding of how flying works, and all of a sudden it doesn't seem so scary anymore.
            I had 2 friend in the back of the plane. And even though I can't think of any reason they'd trust me with their life, they seemed just as excited about it as I was.
            But they had done this before, so they knew what to expect and knew it'd be fine!

            My introductory flight was with <a href="http://www.caliairways.com/CalAir/index.php/flight-training/intro-flight">California Airways</a> and cost around $300.

            This was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. What a thrill it was. And that view! I can't wait to do this again!
