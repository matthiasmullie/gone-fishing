        <title>(Grand) Canyons around Las Vegas</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
            Once again, I find myself in &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; for work.
            I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; this place, but there's plenty more in this region that I have yet to explore.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And when I say &quot;this region&quot;, I'm going to be generous.
            If I'm flying ~9 000 km (~5 500 mi) anyway, I'm not too worried about traveling another few hours.
            But I've ticked off pretty much anything from my bucket list that is within the range of a day trip from San Francisco, so...
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2018-01-19-las-vegas-mirage-view.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Las Vegas Strip view from The Mirage&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2018-01-19-las-vegas-mirage-view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Las Vegas Strip view from The Mirage&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Las Vegas has a lot going on!
            And roundtrip flights between San Francisco and Las Vegas, they're not too expensive!
            And hotels, while not cheap, are not too crazy either - you definitely get more bang for your buck than you would in San Francisco.
            We (a few friends joined me on this trip) decided to book a room at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-mirage.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;The Mirage&lt;/a&gt;, where we woke up to a wonderful view of the Strip.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            And it's not just the city, which &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/what-happens-in-vegas/&quot;&gt;I've explored before&lt;/a&gt;, but there's so much more to see in the area.
            There's no shortage of (extended) day trip opportunities from here: the Grand Canyon, the Mojave Desert, Death Valley, Zion National Park, Antelope Canyon or Bryce Canyon, to name but a few.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, I couldn't stay longer than a weekend, so I'm going to have to save most of that list for a later trip.
            But the Grand Canyon, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/75&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, that was going to happen right this weekend!
            I was going to rent a car and drive to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon National Park&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;grand-canyon&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But the rental car plan evaporated as soon as I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sundancehelicopters.com/tours/grand-canyon-helicopter-tour&quot;&gt;affordable helicopter tours into the Grand Canyon&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery pull-right col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2018-01-19-grand-canyon-colorado-river.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Colorado River from above&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2018-01-19-grand-canyon-colorado-river.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colorado River from above&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2018-01-19-grand-canyon-view-from-heli.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Hilly terrain around the Grand Canyon&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2018-01-19-grand-canyon-view-from-heli.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hilly terrain around the Grand Canyon&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I usually value flexibility and that was going to be the most important trade-off with a helicopter tour: I wouldn't be able to choose where I'd go, how long I'd stay there, and where I'd go next.
            On the other hand, I would gain some time: flying would be a lot faster than picking up a car and driving a few hundred kilometers/miles.
            And the tour included a quick stop at the Hoover Dam.
            Plus: I would get to be in a friggin' helicopter.
            Flying into the Grand Canyon nonetheless!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Picking the right tour was a minor point of contention.
            I originally wanted to do the longer tour, where we'd spend a few hours inside the canyon and take part in a riverboat ride on the Colorado River.
            My friend preferred the shorter tour, essentially skipping the boat and spending no more than half an hour inside the canyon.
            With the kind of weather they were predicting at the time we booked the flights, his plan was the safest bet for sure: ain't nobody want to be on that boat when it's raining or close to freezing.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            In hindsight, I wish we would've booked the longer tour.
            Weather was amazing that day - though it did rain &amp; temperatures dropped over 10&amp;deg;C the next day, so I guess we got lucky.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            When you think about the Grand Canyon, you're probably picturing the South Rim.
            This is the Grand Canyon you know from photos, where the canyon is deepest and the views the most spectacular.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The North Rim is a lot more remote and less crowded with tourists.
            It's greener, a little cooler, and it's not so much about the depths of the canyon than it is about the wide views.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But we landed in Grand Canyon West.
            While not as picturesque as the South Rim, it's an Indian reservation and the only place that allows helicopters to land inside the canyon.
            And closer to Las Vegas, too.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            This was a massively different experience than the &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/sights-of-the-panorama-route/#three-rondavels&quot;&gt;Blyde River Canyon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/explore-south-africa/&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, half a year ago.
            While both are among the most impressive canyons in the world, they couldn't be more different.
            Where the Blyde River Canyon is a lush, sub-tropical green, the Grand Canyon is characterized by its desert environment and rock layers.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But the Grand Canyon wasn't the only stop on that tour.
            We started the day with a quick stop at Lake Mead and the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge - the &quot;Hoover Dam Bypass&quot;.
            This bridge sits in front of the Hoover Dam, about 460 m (1500 ft) removed from it.
            It's also the world's highest concrete arch bridge (at 270 m or 890 ft above the Colorado River.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And it offers a pretty &lt;i&gt;dam&lt;/i&gt;n spectacular view of the Hoover Dam, though I had somehow expected it to be even more colossal.
            I'm pretty sure I would've been able to understand just how massive it is if we would've been on or closer to the dam, but I guess the view from the bridge is a lot better.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            After the Hoover Dam, we were taken a little further into the Mojave Desert to the Outdoor Adventures base, where we would board the helicopter into the Grand Canyon.
            We enjoyed a glass of champagne upon landing in the canyon, and burgers &amp; fries were waiting for us when we got back.
            And that was supposed to be the end of the tour, and we would've been taken back to Las Vegas.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But the Outdoor Adventures base had a shooting range, and my friends wanted to try shooting a rifle once.
            I wasn't going to, but they got a really good deal.
            So I joined them &amp; tried out what an M-4 and M-16 feel like: surprisingly little recoil!
            We got a few tries to shoot explosives, but my friends both missed.
            Me: 2 bullets, 2 explosions. &lt;strong&gt;Boom!&lt;/strong&gt;
            I'm sure it was just beginners luck, but I'll surely keep rubbing this victory in their faces!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;red-rock-canyon&quot;&gt;Red Rock Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Sunday: time to leave Las Vegas and catch the flight back to San Francisco.
            But not until 7:30 PM.
            Not enough time to travel too far, but plenty of time for something fun.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            On the western border of Las Vegas, only half an hour from the Strip, lies Red Rock Canyon, a popular hiking destination.
            I would've loved to go for a hike here, but there just wasn't enough time.
            Instead, we drove the 21 km (13 mi) scenic loop, and got out for a quick walk on some of the lookout spots.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The perfect way to end a hectic weekend!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Missed Christmas in Paris</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/missed-christmas-in-paris/"/>
        <updated>2017-12-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/missed-christmas-in-paris</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row no-margin&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My girlfriend is a big fan of Christmas &amp; the holiday spirit, but we didn't have vacation until after Christmas.
        What better place to enjoy the remaining Christmas lights in the City of Light, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Wrong!&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        There's plenty to do in Paris in the festive season, though.
        There are more than a dozen Christmas markets scattered throughout the French capital, where you can buy your Christmas decorations, arts &amp; crafts, or simply enjoy a Raclette dish with a glass of Glühwein.
        There are a couple of ice skating rinks, including one on the Eiffel Tower's first floor (though not this year.)
        And there's Christmas decoration and lights everywhere, making this city even more romantic.
        But it sure didn't take the French long to tear down their Christmas decorations: there wasn't much left when we got there, on December 27.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    

    &lt;p&gt;
        After spending most of the day wandering around Paris without coming across Christmas markets, we figured we'd head back to La Défense, the modern business district located at the western end of the Historical Axis of Paris.
        We figured the business district wouldn't be too busy in the week between Christmas &amp; New Year's, and we'd score a good hotel rate here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/citizenm-paris-la-defense.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;citizenM&lt;/a&gt;.
        We had seen there was still a Christmas market here, a pretty big one, while we were walking towards the metro station on our way to the historic center.
        But when we got back, we learned that this was the last day for this market, and it had just closed.
        We quickly got back on the metro towards Montmartre, where we exited the station just in time to overhear one of the vendors trying to sell his last food before closing up.
        Oh well!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        We ended up relearning the importance of doing at least some minor research before going on holiday.
        But that's alright - Paris has enough to offer!
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Montreal: a slice of Europe in the Americas</title>

        <updated>2017-08-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/montreal-a-slice-of-europe-in-the-americas</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Whenever I travel, I get so excited &amp;amp; I usually start making plans way ahead of time.
            But not this time, for my trip to Montreal.
            Not that I didn't look forward to it, but I left the day after getting back from our vacation to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/explore-south-africa/&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and planning that road trip had occupied most of my free time.
            But even though I was only there for a few days and hadn't made any plans, this city didn't disappoint.
            Some of the best experiences come unexpected, I guess!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Montreal is the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; largest city in Canada and the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest French-speaking city in the world (behind Paris, Kinshasa &amp; Abidjan.)
            But if your French is bad, you'll have nothing to worry about as long as you speak English.
            I didn't really know anything about Montreal except that it gets really cold in winter, with a lot of snow.
            But this was summer, and weather was amazing!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Thank God it was, because a friend of mine who lives there always told me that this is a city that needs to be experienced on foot.
            I never really quite understood what he meant by that, but I believe I do now.
            Public transportation is good - with a decent metro &amp;amp; bus network - but there's a lot to be seen in a relatively small area.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-17-montreal-place-d-armes.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Place d'Armes, with the Bank of Montreal head office, New York Life Insurance Building &amp;amp; Aldred Building. Missing from the picture is the Notre-Dame Basilica.&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-17-montreal-place-d-armes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Place d'Armes, with the Bank of Montreal head office, New York Life Insurance Building &amp;amp; Aldred Building. Missing from the picture is the Notre-Dame Basilica.&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            To be fair, I haven't exactly explored all of Montreal.
            I stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/le-centre-sheraton-montreal-quebec.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Le Centre Sheraton Montreal Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, right in the middle of Montreal's downtown area.
            I was only here for a few days and spent just about all of my time in downtown and the Old Town/Old Port.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Founded in 1642, it's one of the older North-American cities and it still shows: in between the skyscrapers and the more modern landmarks that were built for the 1967 Expo &amp;amp; 1976 Olympics, are a ton of old buildings that scream the grandeur of the French colonial empire and the height of the British empire.
            Well, old&amp;hellip; You won't find buildings as old as you could see in Europe.
            But relative to most other North American cities, there sure is a lot.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But there's more to Montreal, and that American-European blend is magical.
            Shopping is fun and easy in the many malls and big-brand stores in and around the Rue Sainte-Catherine, while the abundance of small bars and bistros make it very cozy.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A few blocks north-east of Rue Sainte-Catherine is Mont Royal, the hill that gave the city its name.
            The eastern half of that hill is now a park: Parc du Mont Royal, designed by the same architect who did &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/#central-park&quot;&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;.
            If you like a nice walk or jog, this is the place to go: it's a 6 km (~ 3.5 mi) round-trip trail to the top of the park, where a stunning view of the Montreal skyline awaits you at the Mount Royal Belvedere.
            Or extend that jog with a few kilometers if you want to see some more of the park, like the Lac aux Castors or the Mount Royal Cross.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cape Town has it all</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/cape-town-has-it-all/"/>
        <updated>2017-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/cape-town-has-it-all</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We came in to Cape Town with wild expectations, and it didn't disappoint, even though the travel agency had done a good job of trying to discourage us from visiting Cape Town this time of year - it was winter after all.
            But I'm used to terrible weather so I persevered, and I'm so glad I did!
            Our list of things we wanted to do was long, and time was short.
            We had to make drastic cuts in that list, so&amp;hellip; some day, we'll be back!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Cape Town is a popular tourist destination in large part thanks to its natural setting (with Table Mountain &amp;amp; the nearby Cape of Good Hope) and because of its western feel it's a very accessible multicultural city.
            We spent 3 nights on the northern slopes of Table Mountain in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/de-tafelberg-guesthouse.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Tafelberg Guest House&lt;/a&gt; with an amazing view of the Cape Town City Bowl, the central business district flanked by Table Mountain and Signal Hill.
            The neighborhood our guest house was in a very quiet and relaxed.
            But the City Bowl is relatively small and we only had to walk/drive a few blocks to Kloof Street to find a wealth of restaurants and bars.
            And the other side of the City Bowl - the V &amp;amp; A Waterfront area - is only 5 km (3 mi) away.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;v-a-waterfront&quot;&gt;V &amp;amp; A Waterfront&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, modeled after the successful San Francisco &amp;amp; Sydney harbor projects, has brought the Cape Town docks back to life.
            This is still a working harbor, but with the Victoria Wharf Shopping Center and the many restaurants, the Cape Wheel, a few museums and an aquarium, an open-air theatre for live shows, a food market and so much more, this area is perfect for shopping, drinking, eating, relaxing and soaking up the vibrant atmosphere.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I especially loved the V &amp;amp; A &lt;q&gt;Market on the Wharf&lt;/q&gt; food market and &lt;q&gt;The Watershed&lt;/q&gt;.
            The food market features around 35 stalls that offer a wide variety of street food and drinks.
            From Mexican to Thai, pizza to sushi, cheese to chocolate and juices to beer: there's something for everyone.
            I tried a burger with steenbok.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Watershed is a local arts/craft market with 150 tenants, the perfect place to get your souvenir!
            We bought 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artvark.org/zoe-mafham&quot;&gt;local collage artist Zoe Mafham&lt;/a&gt;'s prints and love them.
            They're a nice memory of &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/explore-south-africa/&quot;&gt;this trip&lt;/a&gt; as well as a nice piece of decoration that has caught the eye of all of our guests so far.
            The perfect segue into travel stories!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-09-cape-town-ferris-wheel.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;The Cape Wheel&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;table-mountain&quot;&gt;Table Mountain &amp;amp; Signal Hill&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you want to get to the top of Table Mountain, do no hesitate!
            Go for it the first chance you get - you might not get another!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Hiking to the top of Table Mountain was #1 on my list.
            But we wanted to make the most of our limited time in Cape Town, so we decided to cut the 2 or so hour constant uphill battle &amp;amp; take the cable car instead.
            The cable car had been closed for maintenance just prior to us getting there, so it was going to be crowded.
            And weather was perfect.
            And it was a holiday.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery no-margin pull-right col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-09-cape-town-sun-rays.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Pretty as they may be - clouds be damned!&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-08-09-cape-town-sun-rays.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pretty as they may be - clouds be damned!&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;small&gt;Pretty as they may be - clouds be damned!&lt;/small&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The lady from our guest house had suggested we'd take the hop-on hop-off bus to Table Mountain: we'd be able to buy our tickets on the bus, so we could skip some of the queue (you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tablemountain.net/content/page/rates&quot;&gt;buy them online&lt;/a&gt;.)
            However, it turns out they're only allowed to sell tickets as long as they're not driving up the mountain yet, and unfortunately, I had not inquired in time.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So we got in the line, and it was pretty bad - I estimate it to have been a wait of about an hour.
            Not that having the tickets would've helped much: there are 2 separate queue, but both move at the same speed.
            The folks without tickets just have to take a small detour to the ticket office, where you probably only lose about 5 minutes.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            By the time the queue had advanced halfway, clouds had come rolling in and half of the city was covered already.
            And it was getting worse.
            So we decided to take off - there's no point in taking that cable car if the view's going to be white - our time was scarce enough already!
            We went back to the hop-on hop-off bus to discover some more of the city.
            We didn't get off until we reached the other side of town, at the &lt;a href=&quot;#v-a-waterfront&quot;&gt;V &amp;amp; A Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;.
            By the time we'd had a drink there, the clouds had disappeared.
            We made plans to go back to Table Mountain later in the afternoon, but - you guessed it - cloudy again!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Instead, we drove up to Signal Hill: only a third the height of Table Mountain, but 350 m (1 150 ft) still ain't bad!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-09-cape-town-city-bowl-panorama.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Cape Town City Bowl, flanked by signal hill (left) and Table Mountain (right)&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-09-cape-town-city-bowl-panorama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cape Town City Bowl, flanked by signal hill (left) and Table Mountain (right)&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;robben-island&quot;&gt;Robben Island&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Not far off the coast is a small iconic island that played a significant role in South African history.
            From the Dutch setlers in the 17th century up to 1996: Robben Island has been a prison for much of it's history.
            The location is not unlike &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/behind-bars-in-alcatraz/&quot;&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt;: it's close enough to the coast that it's relatively convenient to get to, but far enough and with strong enough currents that few will attempt an escape (and even fewer will make it.)
            This is the maximum security prison where Nelson Mandela was held during the apartheid regime.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While the main focus of the tightly organized 3h tour on Robben Island is the prison, there's more to be seen - even if the tour won't allow you to wander off or stay around a little longer.
            Just like &lt;a href=&quot;#boulders-beach&quot;&gt;Boulders Beach&lt;/a&gt;, The island is home to a colony of African Penguins.
            But the majestic view of Cape Town and Table Mountain is supposed to be the best!
            &lt;q&gt;Supposed to&lt;/q&gt;, because we didn't get the chance to go.
            We had our tickets (book them ahead of time, they sold out ~2 weeks in advance!), but the tour was canceled due to bad weather.
            Bummer!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Bo-Kaap&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A colorful area on the slopes of Signal Hill, Bo-Kaap (the Malay Quarter) is one of the oldest neighborhoods of Cape Town.
            According to the hop-on hop-off audio guide, the slaves that used to live here were not allowed to paint their houses.
            Once freed, however, they decided to go all out and paint their houses in all kinds of extravagant colors.
            Nowadays, these brightly colored houses are a popular tourist attraction.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;cape-of-good-hope&quot;&gt;Cape of Good Hope&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Cape of Good Hope is where the Dutch started to settle in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.
            They first set up a resupply camp, but it wouldn't be long before the farmers started moving inland and the colony grew.
            The Cape was once believed to be the southernmost tip of the African continent and the dividing point between the Atlantic &amp;amp; Indian Oceans.
            But this has long since been debunked.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Cape of Good Hope was also known as the &lt;q&gt;Cape of Storms&lt;/q&gt;, and I can definitely see why!
            We'd come to the Cape to escape the cloudy, rainy weather in Cape Town that day and, while we did get rid of those, it wasn't exactly beach weather either: this place is very windy!
            Most tourists will gather around the old lighthouse and the wooden sign at Cape Point which, to be honest, are not too spectacular.
            So while everyone is having their picture taken over there, you should get yours from the imposing cliffs, deserted beaches or all of the other amazing scenery in the Cape of Good Hope National Park.
            And if you're into hiking, this is one hell of a spot to &lt;q&gt;take a walk&lt;/q&gt;!
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;boulders-beach&quot;&gt;Boulders Beach&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            40 km (25 mi) south of Cape Town is this tiny little thing called Simon's Town that you'd simply ignore on your way to the Cape of Good Hope, if only it didn't have a pretty nice beach.
            Not a place to go work on your tan, though.
            Boulders Beach is a sheltered beach full of giant granite boulders.
            And Penguins.
            The cutest little African Penguins, thousands of them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But don't be fooled by their looks.
            As far as I'm concerned, this is the most dangerous animal in South Africa!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While we were still making our way to the beach, I spotted 2 of them behind a fence and couldn't wait to snap a quick picture.
            I got as close to the fence as I could so there would be as little of it as possible in the picture, but that was not to the liking of that devilish little penguin.
            In a fraction of a second, that penguin leaped forward and shoved its beak through the fence &amp;amp; around my finger.
            Before I even realized what happened, my phone was on the ground and I had a few cuts in my finger.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I guess what I'm trying to say here is: these penguins are amazing to watch, but don't provoke them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;kirstenbosch&quot;&gt;Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I'm quite indifferent towards botanical gardens, so this didn't originally make it on our list of things we were going to do in Cape Town.
            But with the weather messing up our plans to visit &lt;a href=&quot;#robben-island&quot;&gt;Robben Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#table-mountain&quot;&gt;Table Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, we suddenly had to improvise.
            And it was pretty much on our way from the peninsula (&lt;a href=&quot;#cape-of-good-hope&quot;&gt;Cape of Good Hope&lt;/a&gt;) back to the Cape Town City Bowl anyway.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Kirstenbosch botanical gardens, part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1007&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, sit on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain and it's the starting point for several routes to the top of Table Mountain (among which the popular Skeleton Gorge, or Smuts Track.)
            With 528 ha (36 of which are cultivated), the gardens are quite big and home to a wide variety of plants and over 100 different bird species.
            We got lucky to see this Cape Eagle-owl, still holding on to a mouse he caught.
            Someone had to point it out to us, though - I otherwise wouldn't have spotted it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-08-10-cape-town-bird.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I have no idea what bird this is&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-10-cape-town-cape-eagle-owl.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Cape eagle-owl&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And there is so much more to do around Cape Town if you have some more time to spend there: from the winelands north of Cape Town to the Garden Route east.
            Or go on safari if you haven't in other parts of the country already.
            And I suppose you should at least consider visiting the townships.
            For your own safety, you should book an official township tour instead of going all by yourself.
            We didn't manage to fit this into our schedule, but going by the stories from people who did, your experience may vary: some have described it as an eyeopener into the lives of these people, while others felt like they were on an inappropriate &lt;q&gt;people safari.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>St Lucia's rich biodiversity</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/st-lucias-rich-biodiversity/"/>
        <updated>2017-08-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/st-lucias-rich-biodiversity</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            St. Lucia, a small tourist town, is the ideal hub from where to discover the diverse fauna and flora of the &lt;a href=&quot;#isimangaliso-wetland-park&quot;&gt;iSimangaliso Wetland Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;#hluhluwe-imfolozi-game-reserve&quot;&gt;Hluhluwe-iMfolozi game reserve&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;St. Lucia&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            St. Lucia is a cosy little town on the far east side of South Africa.
            It mostly lives off of the tourism drawn in by the wonderful iSimangaliso Wetland Park (formerly known as the Greater St. Lucia Wetlands Park) and about half the town are guest houses.
            We spent our nights at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/avalone-guest-house-st-lucia.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Avalone Guest House&lt;/a&gt; on east the edge of the town, where the garden borders the bush and the occasional buck can be seen from the pool.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            It's a small town.
            The other side of the town is a mere 5 blocks away, a 10 minute walk.
            That's where you'll find the town's main street with all the restaurants, shops &amp;amp; everything alse a tourist needs: Mckenzie Street.
            Just make sure to carry a flashlight at night, because that's when some of the hippos that live in the estuary roam the streets.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            That estuary, one of the largest in Africa, is the scene of St. Lucia's most popular attractions: the Hippo &amp;amp; Croc Boat Cruise.
            There are 1200 nile crocodiles and 800 hippos, so you're pretty much guaranteed a few amazing sightings during the 2 hours estuary cruise.
            And if you're really lucky, you might find an antelope attempting to cross the shallow estuary.
            But the odds of them making it are low with that many crocs on the lookout&amp;hellip;
        &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-08-05-isimangaliso-eagle-fish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;American eagle, having just caught a fish&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;h2 id=&quot;isimangaliso-wetland-park&quot;&gt;iSimangaliso Wetland Park&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The iSimangaliso Wetland Park is a lot smaller than &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/kruger-park-safari/&quot;&gt;Kruger National Park&lt;/a&gt; and doesn't have the same concentration of animals.
            The St. Lucia lake divides the park into an eastern &amp;amp; western shores, the latter of which is best for game viewing: since the reintroduction of the lion just a few years ago, it's again home to the big 5.
            The eastern shore lacks the lion and the elephant, although we were told elephants did cross over a few years ago, during a drought so bad that the estuary nearly dried up and they had to cross over in order to find water by the ocean.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We joined a night drive safari in the western shores, but didn't get to see any of the big five animals.
            Compared to what we had experienced on our safaris in Kruger, this was was no match: this jeep had a roof, there was no separate tracker, the concentration of animals was lower and consequently, the guide has less stories to tell.
            But I realize that we had been spoiled in Kruger, and this was still very much an enjoyable safari - it just didn't feel as adventurous &amp;amp; wild.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            This is a big 5 reserve, but there are better places to go check those off of your sightings list.
            That's not what this park is about.
            It's about diversity.
            Of ecosystems, of habitats.
            And that also means a staggering diversity of animal species beyond the big 5.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                iSimangaliso must be the only place on the globe where the oldest land mammal (the rhinoceros) and the world’s biggest terrestrial mammal (the elephant) share an ecosystem with the world’s oldest fish (the coelacanth) and the world’s biggest marine mammal (the whale.)
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;footer&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/footer&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The iSimangaliso Wetland Park is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/914&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, and in this relatively small area are 8 interlinked ecosystems, making it the most diverse park in Africa:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;grasslands&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;woodlands&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;wetlands&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;swamps&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;lakes&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;beaches&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;coastal forests&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;coral reefs&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            You can self-drive through some of these ecosystems on the various loops (pan loop, vlei loop, dune loop, grassland loop and forest loop) around the main road between St. Lucia and Cape Vidal and the scenery is a-ma-zing!
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Cape Vidal is a bay on the north end of the eastern shores, with an unspoilt beach from where - if you get lucky - you may even see a humpback whale.
            Because of the rock reef and the year round warm Indian Ocean currents, it is the perfect spot to go swimming.
            Or snorkeling, like I had wanted to do.
            But that didn't happen because of unfortunate timing: low tides were early in the morning, or late in the evening (either too early or too late, because the park's gates close at night.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;If you are into diving, you probably want to go even further north, to the Sodwana Bay coral reefs.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;h2 id=&quot;hluhluwe-imfolozi-game-reserve&quot;&gt;Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The reserve that saved the white rhino from going extinct by setting up a conservation program where there were less than 100 white rhinos left.
            Nowadays, there are an estimated 20 000 white rhinos.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            In addition to an abundance of rhinos, this reserve boasts the big 5 as well.
            Compared to the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, this reserve feels a lot more like Kruger Park.
            Just smaller and with a different topology.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            From St. Lucia, it's a short 45 min drive to the Nyalazi Gate, from where you can take a right to the Hluhluwe part of the reserve (which is more hilly) or turn left for iMfolozi (more open.)
            We took a left, past the Mpila camp, towards the Sontuli loop. This is supposed to be the best area for game viewing, and we did see quite a lot: baboons, zebra, warthog, giraffes, an elephant, a few buffalo herds, and a whole lot of rhinos.
            No cats, but that's to be expected - they mostly sleep during the day&amp;hellip;
            All in all, not bad for a short self-drive!
            Not bad at all.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kruger Park safari</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/kruger-park-safari/"/>
        <updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/kruger-park-safari</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Along with the Serengeti, Kruger National Park must be one of Africa's most iconic safari destinations.
            It is home to an astounding diversity of wildlife, including the Big Five (buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion &amp;amp; rhino.)
            And of all African wildlife parks, Kruger has to be the most well-equipped and maintained park making it an ideal self-drive safari destination.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            But we stayed at a private game lodge and it wasn't until later on &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/explore-south-africa/&quot;&gt;our South Africa trip&lt;/a&gt; that we'd do some self-drives.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Private reserve vs self-drive&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The #1 reason to opt for a self-drive: &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;.
            Full service private game lodges are more exclusive and therefore more expensive, so you may prefer to find other lodging: the cheapest bungalows in the self-catering Kruger Park rest camps go for around $100 a day for 2 persons.
            Tents or camp sites are even cheaper, if you're adventurous.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And if you are, you may also prefer the &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt; of a self-drive: you're in charge of where to go, and at what pace.
            And the &lt;strong&gt;sense of accomplishment&lt;/strong&gt; that comes with having successfully tracked down that coveted animal.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A guided safari drive, on the other hand, puts you in the hands of a capable and experienced guide/tracker who &lt;strong&gt;knows the terrain and the animals&lt;/strong&gt;.
            They know how to track them, whereas you would probably be driving blind, crossing your fingers until something appears - unless if you use the sighting boards.
            They can also &lt;strong&gt;drive around at night&lt;/strong&gt;, while self-drivers have to be off the roads before the gates close, before most of the predators become active.
            And not only are the odds of a sighting better, so is the quality: when you do spot something, they can also &lt;strong&gt;go off-road and move closer&lt;/strong&gt; to the animals or get a better angle.
            Such guided safaris can also be booked from the Kruger Park rest camps, so you don't necessarily have to be in a private game lodge.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-02-kruger-safari-pool.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Safari in Kruger National Park&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-02-kruger-safari-pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Safari in Kruger National Park&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But the private lodges have another advantage!
            We were in a camp in the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve, a reserve that shares (unfenced) borders with Kruger National Park.
            This reserve is &lt;strong&gt;private property&lt;/strong&gt; of about 60 camps that share their grounds: game drives of one camp can freely roam the area of another camp (just not the grounds of individual land owners who want to be left alone.)
            We were told that the Klaserie alone is big enough to drive around non-stop for 4 days, without having to use the same roads twice.
            While the animals can freely cross over, the other tourists can not.
            The camps cooperate and &lt;strong&gt;share sightings over the radio&lt;/strong&gt; so you might run into another jeep at an interesting sighting, but never the chaotic queue of a self-drive.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While a private game lodge is more expensive, it doesn't necessarily have to cost an arm and a leg.
            Some do, but others are quite reasonably priced considering that all of your meals, game drives &amp;amp; conservation levy is included, and the level is service is unmatched.
            We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/xanatseni-private-camp.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Xanatseni Private Camp&lt;/a&gt;, a top notch camp at a reasonable price.
            It was the most expensive accommodation on our trip, but by far the most unforgettable.
            I wished we'd stayed for longer, and I would go back in a heartbeat.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-03-kruger-xanatseni-camp.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Xanatseni Private Camp&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;A day at a private camp&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td style=&quot;width: 80px&quot;&gt;05:30&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake up call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;A gentle knock on the window to wake you up (increasingly louder until you do)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;06:00&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee, tea and rusks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;You woke up early and will be on game drive for a few hours: you'll need that coffee!&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;06:15&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning game drive departs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    It's dark when the game drive leaves and the tracker will scan the terrain with spotlights until the sun come up.
                    It's pretty chilly at first (at least in winter, but blankets are provided) because you're in an open vehicle, with up to 9 others.&lt;br /&gt;
                    About halfway into the game drive, you can get out the jeep in a safe spot for a coffee &amp;amp; a muffin.
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;09:15&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning game drive returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;09:30&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    You're really hungry by now, so after a quick refreshment, you join the rest of the guests for a delicious breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;
                    You're free to do as you please until lunch.
                    Maybe get in the watch tower and wait for an animal to come drink from that watering hole near the camp?
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;14:00&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    Better hope the other guests are nice folks (they were amazing people!), because you'll spend a lot of time together: 2 game drives &amp;amp; 3 meals a day!&lt;br /&gt;
                    Only a little while before the next game drive.
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;15:30&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon game drive departs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    Second game drive of the day, but it starts an hour later in summer.&lt;br /&gt;
                    The cats wake up and prepare for their hunt - hope you'll get to see one!&lt;br /&gt;
                    When the sun is setting, you stop for a sundowner: a quick drink and a light snack.
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;19:00&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon game drive returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;19:15&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-drinks around the fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;

            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;19:30&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;
                    After a delicious dinner, listen to the other guest's stories around the camp fire.
                &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Because of the nature of a safari, you're bound to have a few stories to tell.
            Most of us just don't happen to live in the wilderness and this is a far cry from our day to day lives.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            During our first lunch - we had just arrived - the other guests warned out to keep an eye out at night.
            After dinner, most guests like to stick around the &lt;q&gt;entertaining area&lt;/q&gt; to keep talking with the other guests, which is what they'd done the night before.
            The entertaining area is where meals are served, but there's also a bar and a few sofa.
            The building opens up to the pool &amp;amp; a few outdoor lounge chairs outside, and a camp fire on the other side.
            While they were having a final drink around the camp fire, &lt;strong&gt;a few hyenas and a leopard had entered the camp&lt;/strong&gt; to drink from the pool.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, nothing this exciting happened to us (we didn't even get to see a leopard at all.)
            The next night, when we were around the camp fire, we heard something ruffle in the bush right behind us.
            I grabbed a flashlight just to see a skunk-link animal running off.
            Curious as to what it was, we ran around (through the entertainment area instead of the edges of the bush) to try to locate it again.
            The on-guard guide was there and had also spotted it: it turned out not to be a skunk, but a &lt;strong&gt;honey badger&lt;/strong&gt;, who we just saw enter the camp fire area.
            Although it looked almost cudly at night &amp;amp; from afar, this animal is quite notorious for its fearlessness.
            But this little guy was just looking for a safe spot - he was wounded.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We didn't spend the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; evening around the camp fire: we had asked our guides if we could borrow some of their flash-/spotlights and &quot;hang out&quot; in the watch tower.
            It was not a success, though.
            For the most part, all we could see was a few antelopes coming near the park.
            We'd also thought we heard the boar that we had seen hanging around the camp earlier that day.
            And while I'm not an expert, I'm pretty sure we saw a hyena quite close to the camp (it has a pretty recognizable sound.)
            But we were interrupted after a good hour when our guide came up to urge us to go inside: those boar noises we had heard were &lt;strong&gt;leopard calls&lt;/strong&gt;, and it must've been within 100 m (~ 110 yd) of the camp.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            That night, we had all heard monkey noises.
            Some (including us) had even heard a &lt;strong&gt;monkeys on the roof of our houses&lt;/strong&gt;.
            And some (including us) had heard a few monkeys fight, much later in the night (and they had tossed around our garden furniture.)
            But it wasn't until the morning that we realized how many monkeys there were, when we saw a monkey drop and run over the roof.
            Followed by another one. And another one. And another. There must've been around 20-25.
            Then 30 more jump off of another tree.
            That's one of those moments when you realize who this land really belongs to, and that you're just a visitor/intruder.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-02-kruger-baboons.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Baboons visiting the camp&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-02-kruger-baboons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baboons visiting the camp&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It never really felt scary, though.
            Not even when we got a &lt;strong&gt;flat tire&lt;/strong&gt;, though that probably would've been a lot worse during a self-drive.
            I think the most scary thing was when we were &lt;strong&gt;eye to eye with an aggressive elephant&lt;/strong&gt;, about 30 m (~30 yd) away - a distance that it can cover in about 2 seconds.
            It intended to charge us and we had nowhere to go (we were off-road &amp;amp; facing the animal), but our guide told us that fleeing would be a bad idea anyway: it would just chase us down!
            So we just stood there, holding our grounds to intimidate the elephant.
            When it did move closer, we'd wait a minute and move back a few meters, then hold our ground again.
            It worked, but that's intense!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Or that time that we were right next to a pack of sleepy lions - so close that I could pet them had I wanted to.
            Half an hour later, we were enjoying our sundowner not too far away when we see another vehicle coming in our direction with its spotlights shining on something.
            Those same &lt;strong&gt;lions had gone out to hunt&lt;/strong&gt;!
            It didn't take us long to get back in the jeep.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Animals&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Game viewing is a game of chance.
            Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't.
            Our first 2 game drives were not a huge success: we saw a few elephants, but in terms of &lt;q&gt;big game&lt;/q&gt;, that was about it.
            But we've seen a lot of antelopes and birds, among which the &lt;q&gt;suicide bird&lt;/q&gt; (I forgot its real name): to impress the ladies, it'll fly up, then do a vertical dive, only to pull up when it's about to smack into the ground.
            We actually saw one do the dive.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We had more luck after that: that pack of lions, a group of wildebeest, elephants again, giraffes, rhinos (that I didn't manage to get a good picture of here), and 2 horny hippos (one of which had a turtle on its back.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I still regret only staying here for 2 days - who know what else we would've encountered here!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I strongly recommend anyone going to Kruger Park to also visit the &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/sights-of-the-panorama-route/&quot;&gt;Panorama Route&lt;/a&gt;, a mere few hours away.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Sights of the Panorama Route</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/sights-of-the-panorama-route/"/>
        <updated>2017-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/sights-of-the-panorama-route</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            South Africa's R532 - in the north-east, not too far from Kruger National Park - is dubbed the Panorama Route.
            With good reason: it offers some of the best South-African landscapes at the many viewpoints along the way.
            
            For anyone &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/kruger-park-safari/&quot;&gt;going to Kruger Park&lt;/a&gt;, the Panorama Route is a must-see, as it's only about 1 to 2 hours away from the southern Kruger Park gates.
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;p&gt;
            This was the first stop on our &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/explore-south-africa/&quot;&gt;South Africa trip&lt;/a&gt; and we spent 2 nights at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/za/idle-amp-wild-chalet.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Idle &amp;amp; Wild Guesthouse&lt;/a&gt; in Hazyview.
            I've been impressed with most of our accommodations in South Africa, and this one was no different.
            Our room was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; big: 2 bedrooms, a bathroom with shower &amp;amp; bath, a kitchen &amp;amp; living room area, a private garden area with BBQ equipment and outdoor shower.
            And a cosy breakfast area with an amazing garden and pool.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;
                Even though the guest house is only 16 &amp;amp; 17 km (~10 mi) away from the Phabeni &amp;amp; Numbi Gates, we were only here for the Panorama Route, and I'd suggest you do the same.
                If you're going to Kruger Park, you really want to find accommodation inside the park - you want to hear the animals sneaking around your camp at night!
            &lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            About 45 minutes from Hazyview is Sabie, where we started our quest for beautiful scenery on a not even 100 km (~60 mi) drive to the north end of the Blyde River Canyon.
            But don't underestimate the time you'll spend on the Panorama Route!
            You could easily drive the entire length in 1:30h (just watch out for potholes!) but you'll need to get out of your car, pay a small cover/parking charge, and walk a little bit for most of the viewpoints.
            But most of the time will be spent admiring the waterfalls &amp;amp; vistas!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;horse-shoe-falls-lone-creek-falls-bridal-veil-falls-sabie-falls&quot;&gt;Horse Shoe Falls, Lone Creek Falls, Bridal Veil Falls &amp;amp; Sabie Falls&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you like waterfalls, you're in for a treat: there is no shortage of waterfalls along the Panorama Route.
            These 4 falls around around Sabie are a nice starter.
            Just try to be aware of how much time you spend here, because you'll really want to see a lot more!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you're short on time, I would cut some (or all) of these in favor of the rest on this list.
            There will be more waterfalls along the Panorama Route - bigger &amp;amp; better.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;mac-mac-pools-falls&quot;&gt;Mac Mac Pools &amp;amp; Falls&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-07-31-panorama-route-macmac-falls.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-padding&quot; title=&quot;Mac Mac Falls&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-07-31-panorama-route-macmac-falls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mac Mac Falls&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Only a short drive from Sabie, the Mac Mac Falls - named after the many Scottish gold miners - is probably the most famous waterfall.
            It has twin falls falling down about 65 m (~215 ft), although the one side had mostly dried out when we were there.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            After parking your car right next to the R532, you'll walk for a few hundred meters along a wooden &amp;amp; stone walkway with some views of the river below.
            You won't see the falls until the end of the walkway, when you reach the viewing platform.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you're not rushed, turn your car back around to the Mac Mac Pools.
            While not an impressive sight like the falls, you can swim in this series of pools.
            Or do the Secretary Bird Walk, a 3 km (2 mi) trail that starts at the pools and after which you'll most definitely want a refreshing dive.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;graskop-pilgrims-rest&quot;&gt;Graskop &amp;amp; Pilgrim's Rest&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Before we get to the wild vistas, now might be a good time to get some food: Graskop will be the last town on this route.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you don't mind a little detour, you may just as well want to go into Pilgrim's Rest.
            It's smaller than Graskop and there's not much to do there, but it's an old mining town &amp;amp; it's got some character.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pinnacle-rock-gods-window-wonder-view&quot;&gt;The Pinnacle Rock, God's Window &amp;amp; Wonder View&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            These 3 viewpoints will take you on a little detour on the R534, but it'll drop you off on the R532 again, right before the next waterfall.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Pinnacle Rock is a freestanding piece of rock that rises above the forrest, with a series of small waterfalls next to it.
            God's Window &amp;amp; Wonder View are insanely high viewpoints providing a panorama of the Lowveld and the green Blyde River Canyon.
            A local told us that, on a clear day, you can see all the way to Mozambique from God's Window (which I estimate to be about ~150 km or 95 mi away.)
            I haven't done the math on how far the horizon stretches (I doubt the claims) but this has got to be one hell of a view!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, fog often ruins these viewpoints, as was also the case for us.
            These viewpoints were nothing but white.
            Heck, we could barely see the front of the car until we got back on the R532!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;lisbon-falls&quot;&gt;Lisbon Falls&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Just when you get back on the R532, you'll want to get off again for the Lisbon falls.
            This was my favorite waterfall: not only is it a pretty damn impressive waterfall (the highest, at 94 m or 308 ft) but you also get a good view of the river and the surrounding area.
            And you can take a little walk around here!
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;berlin-falls&quot;&gt;Berlin Falls&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-07-31-panorama-route-berlin-falls.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-padding&quot; title=&quot;Berlin Falls&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Only a few minutes away from the Lisbon Falls (which, again, were named after the Portuguese gold miners) is another waterfall.
            This one's called the &lt;q&gt;Berlin Falls&lt;/q&gt; - can you guess where these fortune seekers were from?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Berlin Falls are roughly 80 m (260 ft) high and start off with a small stream up top that cascades quite wide before leaping into the pool.
            A pool that you can swim in, by the way.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But by now, I had mostly had enough with waterfalls - I was still a little frustrated with the fog messing up the amazing panoramas earlier!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;bourkes-luck-potholes&quot;&gt;Bourke's Luck Potholes&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Where the Blyde &amp;amp; Treur rivers meet, is another attraction.
            There are a few trails that start here, should you want to do some hiking, but the Bourke's Luck Potholes are the main point of interest.
            It's a geological attraction: these 2 rivers have been eroding the sandstone it flows through, forming these neat cylindrical potholes.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;lowveld-view&quot;&gt;Lowveld View&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Past the Bourke's Luck Potholes, we start gaining height until we reach another panoramic viewpoint.
            Unfortunately, this one was also covered in fog.
            Frustrating!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;three-rondavels&quot;&gt;Three Rondavels&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A 10 minute drive from the Lowveld View viewpoint was the last one of this trip.
            And it was mostly fog-free!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Sun was about to set &amp;amp; the viewpoint was closing soon, but we made it!
            I'm still somewhat frustrated about the fog messing up the previous viewpoints, but we wouldn't have made it to this one in time had it not been for that fog ruining the other vistas.
            And I really would've hated to miss this one.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The &lt;q&gt;Three Rondavels&lt;/q&gt; are 3 rocks that somewhat resemble a traditional round African hut (on the right side of the below image.)
            On the left, surrounded by water, is Thabaneng hill.
            What a stunning view of the Blyde River, and of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; biggest canyon in the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It is breathtaking.
            I could spend hours here.
            It was perfect.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So eh, thanks, fog. I guess.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            See the itinerary of this trip on the map below - or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/-25.130645,30.694666/-25.088631,30.778188/-25.000542,30.816329/-24.891191,30.754392/-24.932766,30.844152/-24.912048,30.854459/-24.876541,30.88878/-24.868313,30.896741/-24.861687,30.835869/-24.843737,30.842609/-24.672758,30.807092/-24.604216,30.815722/-24.572182,30.798798&quot;&gt;open it in Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;blyde-dam-visitor-deck&quot;&gt;Extra: Blyde Dam Visitor Deck&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I loved the view of the canyon so much that I just wanted to see it once more before we left the region.
            I wasn't going to miss the evening &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/kruger-park-safari/&quot;&gt;game drive in Kruger Park&lt;/a&gt;, but we had a few more hours.
            Instead of doing the Panorama Route again, I decided to check out the other side of the canyon.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While the highway north on the other side of the canyon (R40) is a lot busier than the Panorama Route, it seems that a lot less people come this way to check out the canyon.
            The Blyde Dam Visitor Centre was closed, but that was ok.
            The boat tour, however, was open.
            But we didn't have time for that.
            I was only here for the view anyway!
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    The hill on the far right is Thabaneng hill (and behind it, our viewpoint from the day before.)&lt;br /&gt;
                    And the hill just to the left of it is the Three Rondavels, as seen from the side.
                &lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Explore South Africa</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/explore-south-africa/"/>
        <updated>2017-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/explore-south-africa</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We wanted to do something different this year.
            A culture and experience that we're not used to.
            What about a safari in Africa?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I was told that South Africa is a great place to start exploring Africa if you've never been there before.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Why South-Africa?&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            For starters, its &lt;strong&gt;nature is diverse&lt;/strong&gt;: there is something for everyone with more than 2 500 km coast line bordering 2 different oceans, the Kalahari desert in the north-west and tropical forests in the south-east, the Drakensbergen mountain range, Cape Town's Table Mountain, the Blyde River Canyon, and countless wildlife parks with all sorts of different topology.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-07-31-panorama-route-bourkes-luck-potholes-canyon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Blyde River Canyon&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-07-31-panorama-route-bourkes-luck-potholes-canyon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blyde River Canyon&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;Blyde River Canyon&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And it's &lt;strong&gt;affordable &amp;amp; convenient&lt;/strong&gt;.
            It's one of Africa's largest economies and there is infrastructure to get around the country.
            Tourist attractions will require an entry fee, but they're well-maintained - and there's toilets everywhere.
            Cities are developed and modern (especially Cape Town has this Western feel.)
            That said, this economy doesn't favor everyone: unemployment is very high and there is a lot of poverty in South Africa.
            Especially in the more rural areas and the townships, both of which can be intimidating.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Lastly: most of the people you'll meet will understand and speak &lt;strong&gt;English&lt;/strong&gt;.
            Just don't expect to understand them when they talk to each other: with 11 national languages, chances are they'll use a mix of some of those.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            South Africa has had a wild history, with a lot of struggles in the last few centuries.
            In the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch started to settle around the Cape of Good Hope.
            In late 1700s, the British started to take control and a century later, a few wars broke out between the British and the Zulu Kingdom, and the British and the &lt;i&gt;Boers&lt;/i&gt; (the Dutch settlers.)
            In 1961, South Africa became an independent republic, but the apartheid (racial segregation) had already started a few years before.
            Nelson Mandela (a former political prisoner during the apartheid) eventually became the first democratically elected president in 1994, a year after the apartheid had ended.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Big 5&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elephant&lt;/strong&gt;: check!&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhino&lt;/strong&gt;: check!&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lion&lt;/strong&gt;: check!&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffalo&lt;/strong&gt;: check!&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-05-isimangaliso-buffalos.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Buffalo&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We may come one short of having seen the big 5, but at this point I'm not convinced that a &lt;strong&gt;leopard&lt;/strong&gt; even exists.
            As far as I'm concerned, a leopard's not too different from a unicorn.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While I would've loved to have seen a leopard, we didn't come here to check off boxes.
            I'm happy to have seen the &lt;q&gt;big 4&lt;/q&gt; and many other equally amazing animals like crocodiles &amp;amp;amp; hippos, monkeys, zebras and wildebeest, and a whole variety of antelopes, to name but a few.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Our itinerary&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, we didn't have anywhere near the time or budget to explore all of South-Africa: there are so many more places I would've wanted to visit but didn't get around to.
            The Cape Winelands, the Garden Route, the Drakensberg mountains, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, the Cradle of Mankind and Soweto, are just a few of the places that I'd would've loved to visit as well.
            Because this was our very first trip in Africa &amp;amp;amp; I don't know the continent, I felt more comfortable with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joker.be/&quot;&gt;a travel agent&lt;/a&gt;.
            After some back and forth, this is the itinerary we eventually came up with.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We landed in Johannesburg, where we rented a Toyota Corolla and took off to Hazyview, a nice little city near the Panorama Route, about 4 hours away.
            4 hours is more than enough after having been awake for 24+ hours (half of which in the air.)
            4 hours is plenty, when you're not used to driving on the left side of the road and having your steering wheel on the other side of the car.
            Especially when the sun sets fast and it's dark for the last hour.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But we got used to driving on the other side of road quickly &lt;i&gt;(I only drove in the wrong direction once)&lt;/i&gt; and we spent the next day driving around the absurdly scenic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/sights-of-the-panorama-route/&quot;&gt;Panorama Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-02-kruger-zebra-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Zebra in Kruger National Park&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-08-02-kruger-zebra-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zebra in Kruger National Park&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;Zebra&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-02-kruger-wildebeest-group.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;A group of wildebeest in Kruger National Park&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;Wildebeest (or gnu)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-02-kruger-kudu.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Kudu in Kruger National Park&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2017-08-02-kruger-kudu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kudu in Kruger National Park&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;Kudu&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Next stop: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/kruger-park-safari/&quot;&gt;Kruger Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, where we wouldn't have to touch our car for a few days.
            We spent 2 nights in a camp in the Klaserie Private Game Reserve, where we'd enjoy 2 game drives a day with a guide &amp;amp; tracker.
            We'd never done this before, and I was kind of worried that we'd get bored soon, but those game drives were an unforgettable experience.
            And we got to share stories with the other guests around the campfire.
            We were sad to have to leave this place so soon, but alas.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Swaziland&lt;/strong&gt; was the next &lt;q&gt;destination&lt;/q&gt; in that we spent the following night there, but we were only just passing through.
            Our real next destination was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/st-lucias-rich-biodiversity/&quot;&gt;St. Lucia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/st-lucias-rich-biodiversity/#isimangaliso-wetland-park&quot;&gt;iSimangaliso Wetland Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (known for its rich biodiversity and different ecosystems) on the eastern end of South Africa.
            We went on a night drive through the park and a cruise on the estuary, then spent the rest of the time driving around the park by ourselves.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-06-isimangaliso-aerial.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;iSimangaliso Wetland Park from above&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-06-isimangaliso-aerial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iSimangaliso Wetland Park from above&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;iSimangaliso Wetland Park from above&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Our adventure on the east side of South Africa was about to end in Durban, but not before taking a small detour to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/st-lucias-rich-biodiversity/#hluhluwe-imfolozi-game-reserve&quot;&gt;Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, another &lt;q&gt;big 5 park&lt;/q&gt; where the White Rhino was saved from extinction.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Durban&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, did not convince us.
            We'd been informed to stay near the beach rather than venturing into the city: it wouldn't be safe, and there wouldn't be much to do there anyway - not for tourists at least.
            But we didn't even really like the Golden Mile beachfront: the beach was mostly empty &amp;amp;amp; so was the promenade.
            And there was not much else to do (at least not when we were there - I sure hope there's more going on in African summer.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travels/cape-town-has-it-all/&quot;&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is on the other side of the country, so we took a short domestic flight from Durban (if you have the time: fly to Port Elizabeth instead, then drive the Garden Route to Cape Town.)
            This is a wonderful city and there is just so much to do here - I really wished we could've spent some more time here, even if weather wasn't that great.
            I guess I'll have to come back here at some point!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2017-08-09-cape-town-waterfront-stage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Cape Town's V&amp;amp;A waterfront&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2017-08-09-cape-town-waterfront-stage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cape Town's V&amp;amp;A waterfront&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;span&gt;Cape Town's V&amp;amp;A waterfront&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            All in all, we drove for about 2 500 km (1 500 mi), most of which on the east.
            I loved the country and I loved the landscapes, the diverse terrain and wonderful vistas.
            But I can not the same about the roads.
            While the main roads are in perfect shape, you better watch out for cracks and potholes on the other roads.
            If they're tarred at all!
            And let me tell you, Google Maps can take you on some strange &lt;q&gt;roads&lt;/q&gt;!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Seattle, Rain City indeed</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/seattle-rain-city-indeed/"/>
        <updated>2016-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/seattle-rain-city-indeed</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Seattle is located in the north-west corner of the &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/usa/&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; so you should expect some rain.
            You could even expect it to rain every day if your timing's as lousy as mine!
            Who would've thought late October could be so wet?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            It wasn't too long ago that I was in this region: when I was in &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/vancouver-gateway-to-the-great-outdoors/&quot;&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, I was a mere 3 hours away - just on the other side of the border - and weather was a lot better there.
            But that was spring.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I knew that Seattle is a technology hub (I work in that sector after all) and Amazon's headquartered there.
            But that's not what comes to mind when I think of Seattle.
            When I think of Seattle, I hear music: this is where Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Pearl Jam &amp; Macklemore were raised!
            But music's not really something you can &lt;q&gt;visit&lt;/q&gt;, right?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h3&gt;Go-to places&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The 1962 World's Fair grounds, nowadays called the &lt;strong&gt;Seattle Center&lt;/strong&gt;, is a tourist hotspot with Seattle's iconic landmark: the Space Needle.
            But it's full of attractions, like the Pacific Science Center, the Children's Museum &amp;amp; the Museum of Pop Culture, the Memorial Stadium and KeyArena.
            And the &lt;strong&gt;Chihuly Garden &amp;amp; Glass&lt;/strong&gt;, a spectacular museum of glass creations that I didn't get around to visiting, but that was strongly recommended by friends who did go.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            From the Seattle Center, you can take the &lt;strong&gt;Monorail&lt;/strong&gt; (another 1962 World's Fair relic) to Seattle's retail core.
            Walk a few minutes in the direction of the waterfront and you'll end up at &lt;strong&gt;Pike Place Market&lt;/strong&gt;, the oldest public farmer's market in the States and Seattle's favorite tourist attraction.
            Near the north end of the Pike Place Market, across the street, is also where you'll find the very first Starbucks.
            This isn't the exact spot where Starbucks started (the shop has moved), but it still has the original logo.
            Just north of Pike Place Market is &lt;strong&gt;Belltown&lt;/strong&gt;, a trendy neighborhood where you should find some art galleries.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Lastly you may want to go check out &lt;strong&gt;Capitol Hill&lt;/strong&gt;, where the downtown shopping retail core extends along Pike and Pine Streets.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-16-seattle-pike-place-market.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Pike Place Market&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-21-seattle-museum-of-pop-culture.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Museum of Pop Culture&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-10-21-seattle-museum-of-pop-culture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Museum of Pop Culture&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-22-seattle-museum-of-flight.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Museum of Flight&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-10-22-seattle-museum-of-flight.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Museum of Flight&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Museums&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It turns out you can actually go &lt;q&gt;visit&lt;/q&gt; music in Seattle's &lt;strong&gt;Museum of Pop Culture&lt;/strong&gt;, in a psychedelic building that was inspired by Jimi Hendrix's guitar.
            &lt;i&gt;I tried, but I really couldn't see how this resembles a guitar - but it sure is a spectacular building!&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The museum is basically an interactive tour throughout pop music history.
            But most importantly: they have a bunch of instruments &amp;amp; instructions for you to try out and get your groove on.

            That said, I was slightly disappointed in the museum, although I must admit that I have no idea how a music museum could be made any better.
            I'm not a musician (I just like to sing along - like, all the time) and I don't have any background in music.
            I'm sure I would've been able to appreciate the museum a lot more if I had.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But Seattle has a lot of other museums, and there's 1 in particular that was right up my alley: the &lt;strong&gt;Museum of Flight&lt;/strong&gt;.
            You may have read about my &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/i-flew-over-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;introductory Cessna flight&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd gladly take things a step further if only it wasn't such an expensive &lt;q&gt;hobby&lt;/q&gt;.
            But I have a strong interest &amp;amp; fascination in flying and airplanes.
            I loved this museum, and there were a few gems among the hundreds of planes on display (like an Air Force One and the Concorde.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Best vista&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I always seek out scenic overviews of the city, and Seattle has 2 strong contenders:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                The obvious one: the &lt;strong&gt;Space Needle&lt;/strong&gt;, at 184m high, which lets you go outside on a ledge around the revolving top.
                Bonus points for its more remote location, allowing you to capture all of the buildings making up downtown's skyline in 1 frame.
            &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;
                The highest vantage point, however, is the &lt;strong&gt;Columbia Center&lt;/strong&gt;, smack in the middle of Seattle's downtown.
                You're stuck behind glass, but at least you're able to capture Seattle's most defining landmark: the Space Needle!
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But easily the best vista was Seattle's skyline as seen from the ferry headed to Bainbridge Island:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-20-seattle-skyline.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Seattle skyline&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-10-20-seattle-skyline.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; alt=&quot;Seattle skyline&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Every year, Munich celebrates the 200 years old tradition known as Oktoberfest.
            For 16 to 18 days, ending the first Sunday in October, over 6 million visitors visit the &lt;q&gt;Theresienwiese&lt;/q&gt; to drink about as many liters of beer.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I was one of this year's visitors, but I'm not sure how many liters I've had.
            Suffice it to say I sure did my part to help skew those other numbers away from the 1 liter per person average.
            1 liter, that's only 1 of those giant beer pitchers (they're called &lt;q&gt;Maß&lt;/q&gt;) and that was not enough to get me through the weekend!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            There were 5 of us, all guys, and we had been looking forward to this for months!
            One of us had drawn the short straw and drove us for 10+ hours to Munich and back.
            The driving in and of itself was not the problem: I'm sure he was happy to have a comfortable seat while the rest of us fought over the remaining front seat.
            But it also meant he would have to be sober by Sunday morning, when we had to go back.
            I didn't envy him!
            But he's a responsible guy and stayed off the beer on Saturday night - but he did go all out on Friday night!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-hofbrau-festhalle.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Hofbräu festhalle&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-hofbrau-festhalle.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; alt=&quot;Hofbräu festhalle&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Ideally, you'd reserve a table in one of the 14 (big) beer tents.
            Those tents are enormous - some seat over 10 000 guests - but they fill up fast.
            Especially on weekends!
            And without a seat, you may not get served.
            You can either reserve a table in advance, or show up early in the morning to get a free seat.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And that's exactly what we did on Saturday, when we showed up somewhere between 9 and 10 in the morning - way too early for some, after last night's party.
            Except, we didn't actually score a table in any of the tents.
            Weather was perfect and we preferred to be outside.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The terrace filled up quickly and before we knew it, people from all over the world joined our table.
            And that's probably one of the best things about Oktoberfest: you can easily strike up a conversation with a total stranger from across the globe in no time, and all of them will be wearing the traditional lederhosen or dirndls.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-hacker-festzelt.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Hacker festzelt&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-hacker-festzelt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hacker festzelt&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-fair.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Oktoberfest fair&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-10-01-oktoberfest-fair.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oktoberfest fair&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The other best thing would undoubtedly have to be the beer.
            Sure, you could order a soda or water, but those 1 liter beer mugs are what you're here for, right?
            They'll set you back a good €10 each, but you'll get quality Bavarian beer (no others are allowed here) in an enormous pitcher that somehow manages to never let your beer get warm.
            But don't get too confident: if you find yourself puking all over the table, you'll be removed immediately and be asked to pay €30.
            Security is strict, as they should be at an event of this size.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But even if beer is not your thing or you can't score a table, you can have a great time.
            The Hofbräu Festzelt has a standing area and it's right in front of the live band - the perfect spot for a party.
            Or go outside on one of the 200+ carnival rides, get some rest on the grass, and maybe gat a bratwurst when you're feeling hungry - I was surprised by how tasty they were, nothing at all like our bland sausages.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The party stops somewhere between midnight and 1AM but depending on how inebriated you are, the street musicians on the way to the subway could prolong your party for another hour or so.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A weekend in London</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/a-weekend-in-london/"/>
        <updated>2016-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/a-weekend-in-london</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            It had been my 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday and 2 of my friends were about to reach that same milestone.
            When we were younger, we used to go on vacation together, but that was 10 years ago (not counting the trip to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; one of them was also on.)
            Our girlfriends got together and booked all 6 of us a weekend to London. &lt;i&gt;She knows me so well!&lt;/i&gt;
            I had been to London a few times as a kid, but that was a really long time ago and I had been eager to go back for a while now.
            It's Western Europe's largest city. The most visited city of the world, in fact.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Another friend of mine, also an avid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jelmer.pics&quot;&gt;traveller &amp;amp; photographer&lt;/a&gt;, had lived in London for a few years and helped plan the weekend.
            But a weekend, that is not nearly enough time to see it all. Not even close.
            So we mostly ended up doing the usual tourist attractions, and we didn't even have enough time for all of those.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I'm not a morning person at all, but leaving for travel is surprisingly easy!
            We left home early in the morning and drove to Calais to take our car under the channel on a Eurotunnel train.
            It takes about 35 minutes to reach Folkestone.
            London is about an hour away from here (or a little more, once you get stuck in London's traffic.)
            We parked our car and checked into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/novotellondonctiysouth.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;our hotel&lt;/a&gt;, conveniently located near the South Bank of the Thames in central London.
            We wouldn't need - or even want to use - the car for the rest of the weekend: our feet and the Tube's 11 lines would be perfect for getting us around London.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            First destination: the &lt;strong&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park&lt;/strong&gt;, where the 2012 Summer Olympics were held.
            On the park's grounds: the ArcelorMittal Orbit, the London Stadium (now West Ham United FC's home), the London Aquatics Centre and a cycling, hockey and tennis center.
            And a lot of green, making it a great place to escape the busy city.
            But we had only just arrived - we didn't need to escape the crowds yet.
            What I really wanted was to get to the top of the ArcelorMittal Orbit and see the London skyline from up high, then take the 178 m (484 ft) &lt;q&gt;Slide&lt;/q&gt; down.
            Unfortunately, tickets for The Slide were sold out, and most of us didn't really feel like paying and waiting in line just to get to the viewing platform.
            On the way back to the Tube we'd walk through the Westfield Stratford City mall, where we'd found plenty of lunch opportunities.
            But it was too early for lunch, so back to central London!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Because our girlfriends has put this together, we figured we ought to do something for them and we headed to &lt;strong&gt;Regent Street &amp;amp; Oxford Street&lt;/strong&gt;, London's main shopping streets.
            To be fair, we didn't only come here for the girls: I too like walking around crowded streets, especially when they're lined with old buildings this nice!
            After getting a delicious burger, a lot of window shopping and not buying anything, we headed south on Regent Street to arrive at &lt;strong&gt;Piccadilly Circus&lt;/strong&gt;, London's Times Square.
            We got some rest at a nearby park until we headed to the &lt;strong&gt;South Bank&lt;/strong&gt; of the Thames again for dinner.
            It had been a long day by then, so we walked along the South Bank back to the hotel.
            Tomorrow would be another long day and we wouldn't be able to sleep in.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We had an early appointment at the &lt;strong&gt;London Dungeon&lt;/strong&gt;, an interactive &lt;q&gt;museum&lt;/q&gt;/haunted house that lets you relive some of London's most scary historical events, with characters like Guy Fawkes, Jack the Ripper &amp;amp; Sweeney Todd.
            Right next to the London Dungeon is the &lt;strong&gt;London Eye&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the world's biggest ferry wheels (135 m or 443 ft.)
            But the line was long and our time was limited&amp;hellip;
            We crossed the bridge to find lunch (another great burger) on the other side of the Thames, then headed to &lt;strong&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/strong&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While it is still true that &lt;a href=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/48/&quot;&gt;the sun never sets on the British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it is no longer the empire it once was - the largest global empire ever.
            But it was for a pretty damn long time, and London was its capital, and home to the British monarchy.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            From Trafalgar Square, the royal grounds are only a stone's throw away, past the &lt;strong&gt;Admiralty Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, where the road leading up to Buckingham Palace starts.
            But we took a left, to the former main residence of the monarchy: the &lt;strong&gt;Palace of Whitehall&lt;/strong&gt;.
            Most of it burned down a few hundred years ago, though - all that's left is the Banqueting House.
            On the other side of the street, aptly named Whitehall, is the &lt;strong&gt;Horse Guards Parade&lt;/strong&gt;.
            Downing Street 10, the UK Prime Minister's residency, is just around the corner.
            Most of British civil service is in this neighborhood, actually.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We'd stroll around St. James's Park for awhile until we arrived at &lt;strong&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/strong&gt;, just in time to see the Changing of the Guard&amp;hellip; had we arrived an hour earlier.
            Seeing how disappointed we were to have missed it, the Queen invited us for a nice cup of tea, but we had to decline: we probably wouldn't have made the last Eurotunnel train in time, and we all had to work tomorrow.
            So we started walking back, past &lt;strong&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Big Ben&lt;/strong&gt;, across the Westminster Bridge and along the South Bank, back to the hotel.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-08-13-london-buckingham-palace.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Buckingham Palace&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-08-13-london-buckingham-palace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buckingham Palace&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We didn't get to spend nearly enough time at the places we've been to, and there's plenty more we would've liked to visit, like the Tower of London (with the Crown Jewels), Tower Bridge, St. Paul's Cathedral, The Shard &amp;amp; Gherkin.
            And I didn't end up getting a &quot;London from above&quot; view, but that's alright. Next time!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Award of the most waterfalls goes to Plitvice</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/award-of-the-most-waterfalls-goes-to-plitvice/"/>

        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/award-of-the-most-waterfalls-goes-to-plitvice</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pull-right col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-08-01-plitvice-lakes.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Plitvice lakes&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-08-01-plitvice-lakes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plitvice lakes&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Friends who learned about our plans to visit &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/croatia/&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; were quick to recommend the Plitvice Lakes, easily Croatia's most famous national park.
            On an area of only a few km&amp;sup2; are 16 of the most beautiful lakes and I don't know how many waterfalls.
            Too much to count!
            The national park is a lot bigger, but let's be honest, you're only coming for the lakes.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            While the lakes were indeed wonderful (more on that later), there were a few things that irked us, so let's get those out of the way first:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;This place is way too crowded.&lt;/strong&gt;
            The lakes get close to 1.5 million visitors a year, most of which come in the summer.
            We were here in August, smack in the middle of the tourist season, and the walkways around and over the lakes were very crowded.
            And while I do love crowds, they're not really what I'm looking for when exploring nature.
            Despite the crowds, I would still recommend the lakes, but in the off-season.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;There's nothing around here once it gets dark.&lt;/strong&gt;
            While this is a well-frequented tourist attraction, this ain't exactly Disney World.
            Once you're done with your tour around the lakes, there's literally nothing left to do - there's barely any bar or restaurant around here.
            Sure, if you have a car, you could drive for half an hour to a good restaurant, but we didn't.
            We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/jezero.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Hotel Jezero&lt;/a&gt; for 2 days (we were coming from &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/emperor-diocletians-retirement-home-split/&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt; by bus &amp; left to catch our flight in Zagreb 2 days later.)
            While there was nothing wrong with the hotel, I'd recommend a day tour from Zadar (about 1.5h away) or Zagreb (about 2h) instead.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Weather was bad.&lt;/strong&gt;
            When we were in Split and &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/dubrovnik-pearl-of-the-adriatic/&quot;&gt;Dubrovnik&lt;/a&gt;, we'd had nothing but sun all week and temperatures that were off the charts.
            Because of the difference in altitude, I had have expected Plitvice to be slighter cooler (and it was), but it also rained!
            To be fair, it also rained in Split &amp;amp; Dubrovnik that day - just our luck!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Alright, enough with the whining, because despite these little remarks, I have exactly zero regrets of coming here.
            This park is very well kept and there are these nice wooden walkways that lead you around the lakes.
            These walkways could be a turnoff for anyone looking to do serious hiking, but that can be done elsewhere in the park, and these walkways form a few nice trails to get as close to the lakes and waterfalls as possible.
            I have no idea how long the trail is, but - once it had almost stopped raining - we've been walking them for about 5 hours and believe we've seen just about everything.
            If you don't feel like walking the entire trail, you can rely on the ferry &amp;amp; bus services (included in the entrance fee) to take you around the park.
            But then you're guaranteed to miss some sights.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            You'd expect that, after a while, all of the lakes start to look similar.
            Once you've seen a few of them, you've seen them all, right? No!
            These lakes come in every hue between green and blue &lt;i&gt;(that rhymes!)&lt;/i&gt; and they all have features that set them apart.
            Some are shallow and clear enough that you can see sunken trees at the bottom.
            One has an enormous waterfall whereas the other is a long cascade of smaller falls.
            And another one you can cross on that wooden walkway, right next to a series of smaller falls.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But there's no need to pack your swimming gear: as inviting as they look, it's actually forbidden to swim in the lakes in order to protect the fragile ecosystem.
            &lt;i&gt;If you're looking for waterfalls to swim near, you should look into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.np-krka.hr/en/&quot;&gt;Krka National Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Just don't forget to also find a higher vantage point for a great overview of the valley: there's an old, almost hidden away, staircase near Veliki Slap (the largest waterfall at 78 m, or 255 ft.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emperor Diocletian's retirement home: Split</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/emperor-diocletians-retirement-home-split/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/emperor-diocletians-retirement-home-split</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Our tour in &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/croatia/&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; was amazing and so was Split.
            It's not as &lt;q&gt;unique&lt;/q&gt; as, say, &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/dubrovnik-pearl-of-the-adriatic/&quot;&gt;Dubrovnik&lt;/a&gt;, which almost seems stuck in medieval times.
            While Split has a lot of history (with Diocletian's Palace), it is a modern city and - unlike Dubrovnik - it's not overrun by tourists, although you'll still find a ton of them.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Split's main attraction is the remains of the palace where Diocletian spent his post-emperor days.
            Apparently, this is (one of) the best preserved Roman palace(s) in the world, especially the basement halls.
            Nowadays, part of the basement is filled with market stalls selling all sorts of souvenirs, but for a small fee of 40kn (around $6) you'll get access to the rest of the excavated underground remains.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Much less remains of the ground floor, where it is now hard to distinguish remains of the palace from the rest of the city.
            Over hundreds of years, the city has grown on these remains and the two are interwoven.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Central to the palace is the Peristyle: Diocletian's ceremonial court, which includes a sphinx he'd brought in from Egypt.
            Have a drink on the steps around the Peristyle and you'll feel like you're back in Roman times.
            In the Middle Ages, Diocletian's mausoleum was turned into the St. Duje Cathedral &amp;amp; after the addition of the bell tower (climb it, the view is amazing!) this square became a religious center.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-xs-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-30-split-peristyle.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;The Peristyle in Diocletian's Palace&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-07-30-split-peristyle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Peristyle in Diocletian's Palace&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                The Peristyle
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 col-xs-12 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-28-split-riva.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;The Riva, Split's waterfront promenade&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-07-28-split-riva.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Riva, Split's waterfront promenade&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                The Riva
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Bust most of Diocletian's Palace's upper floors hasn't survived and for the most part it's turned into homes and shops.
            Diocletian's Palace makes up about half of the very busy and touristy historic center.
            On the south side is the Riva, the waterfront promenade.
            It's very modern &amp;amp; contrasts beautifully (in my opinion) with the old buildings just a few meters away.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I really would've wanted to go visit the Blue Grotto, a cave where the sunlight reflects in such a way that it radiates blue hues.
            It's supposed to be wonderful, but it's a few hours away by boat.
            We didn't really want to be on a boat all day so we didn't go, but it's still on my list should I ever go back!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We did end up going to an island much closer to Split: Brač - the biggest of the Dalmatian Islands.
            We took the ferry to Supetar, then took the bus to Bol, a town on the other side of the island.
            There really is no particular reason to come to Bol other than Zlatni Rat, one of the world's prettiest beaches with white pebbles, perfect turquoise waters, a pine tree grove bordering the beach and a backdrop of the Brač hills.
            I'm not much of a beach person, but this was perfect.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dubrovnik, Pearl of the Adriatic</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/dubrovnik-pearl-of-the-adriatic/"/>
        <updated>2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/dubrovnik-pearl-of-the-adriatic</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/croatia/&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; is an up-and-coming travel destination.
            It was not on my bucket list yet (not anywhere near the top at least), but we'd heard great things from friends who'd come here.
            I still didn't really know what to expect (&lt;q&gt;unknown is unloved&lt;/q&gt;, as we say) but I kept an open mind and booked us a trip to Croatia.
            It didn't disappoint!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            First stop: Dubrovnik!
            I knew little about Croatia, but I'd heard about it's capital: Dubrovnik.
            &lt;i&gt;What do you mean, Dubrovnik is not the capital of Croatia?&lt;/i&gt;
            No, it's not, but it's one of Croatia's biggest cities with a lot of fame.
            &lt;i&gt;What, not even in Croatia's top 10 cities?&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I can barely name 5 Croatian cities, but the most prominent name is definitely Dubrovnik and I'm sure everyone has heard about this &lt;q&gt;Pearl of the Adriatic.&lt;/q&gt;
            So what makes this town with only 40k inhabitants so special?
            &lt;strong&gt;The walled historic center.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Dubrovnik has had a long and prosperous history, and it was an independent republic for a century or 2.
            Walls were needed to protect the city, and they've never been breached.
            Those walls are now Dubrovnik's main attraction, and you can walk them for 2 km (1.25 km) around the old town.
            We had been advised to do that either in the morning of evening since it can get too hot during the day, but we ignored that advice.
            I can now confirm that I does indeed get too hot during the day!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-27-dubrovnik-west-harbor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;View from the Dubrovnik city walls, incl. Fort Lovrijenac&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-07-27-dubrovnik-west-harbor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; alt=&quot;View from the Dubrovnik city walls, incl. Fort Lovrijenac&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The historic center is inside the walls and it's the prettiest little town I've ever seen.
            It's really small, and completely pedestrianized.
            You may recognize it from Game of Thrones.
            This is the filming location for King's Landing scenes and they're proud about it: there are multiple Game of Thrones tours available, and you won't have to look for long to find Game of Thrones memorabilia.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Nowadays, there are 3 gates where you can enter the old town: Pile, Ploče and Buža Gate.
            All 3 will lead you to Stradun, Dubrovnik's main street.
            Via Pile &amp;amp; Ploče Gate, you'll arrive at respectively the west and east end of Stradun, with Onofrian fountains on either end (the large one near Pile Gate.)
            Buža Gate (in the north) will place you in the middle of Stradun, after having descended the steep narrow streets perpendicular to Stradun.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-25-dubrovnik-stradun.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Dubrovnik's main street: Stradun&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-07-25-dubrovnik-stradun.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dubrovnik's main street: Stradun&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-26-dubrovnik-love-locks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Dubrovnik love locks&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-07-26-dubrovnik-love-locks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dubrovnik love locks&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Near Buža Gate is a cable car that'll take you to the top of Srđ mountain (or you can hike) where the most spectacular view of Dubrovnik can be found, and where &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautikarestaurant.com/panorama-restaurant-bar/&quot;&gt;my favorite restaurant&lt;/a&gt; was.
            You don't necessarily need to eat at the restaurant to enjoy this view, though, but if you're looking for a romantic dinner in Dubrovnik, this place can not be beat!
            There's also an imperial fort and war museum at the top, neither of which we visited.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Most of the historic buildings and monuments are somewhere along or near Stradun.
            It's also the densest area in terms of restaurants and bars, but there's plenty to be found throughout the rest of the town - around the old port, for example, another great place to relax.
            Or Cafe Buža, a cliffside bar just outside of the walls in the south of Dubrovnik with a spectacular view of the Adriatic Sea &amp;amp; Lokrum, the island south of Dubrovnik.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Lokrum island, just off the coast of Dubrovnik, is also worth a (half) day trip.
            Especially if you want to relax on a hot summer day.
            Boat tours depart from the Dubrovnik port every 20 or 30 minutes, and it takes about 20 minutes to reach the island.
            Bring your swimming gear and head south-west to Mrvto More (&lt;q&gt;the Dead Sea&lt;/q&gt;), a little cove with salt water.
            But unfortunately, you won't be able to float like in the Jordan Dead Sea.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-07-27-dubrovnik-lokrum-mrtvo-more.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Mrtvo More: Lokrum's Dead Sea&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-07-27-dubrovnik-lokrum-mrtvo-more.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; alt=&quot;Mrtvo More: Lokrum's Dead Sea&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            North of the cove is a cosy cocktail bar and the field in between Mrvto More and the monastery is perfect for some sunbathing.
            Grab a drink and make friends with some of the peacocks, the island's only inhabitants (you're not allowed to spend the night in Lokrum.)
            Lokrum's other main attraction is the botanical garden, but that didn't really impress me too much.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Like every other tourist, we spent most of our time in Dubrovnik's old town.
            While there's no escaping the tourist crowd, the Lapad peninsula has a very different atmosphere.
            The old town is all about history &amp; culture; Lapad is where Dubrovnik's best beaches are.
            And take a walk around the Lapad promenade or the Šetalište kralja Zvonimira, a charming, pedestrianized street full of bars &amp;amp; restaurants.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Whistler Blackcomb &amp; Garibaldi Provincial Park</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/whistler-blackcomb-garibaldi-provincial-park/"/>
        <updated>2016-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/whistler-blackcomb-garibaldi-provincial-park</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Whistler Blackcomb&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-05-30-whistler-river-of-dreams.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;River of Golden Dreams&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-05-30-whistler-river-of-dreams.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;River of Golden Dreams&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A good 2 hours north of &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/vancouver-gateway-to-the-great-outdoors&quot;&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, along the most scenic Sea To Sky Highway, lie Whistler &amp;amp; Blackcomb, 2 mountains that make up one of the most renowned ski destinations &amp; the largest ski resort in North America.
            The resort hosted most of the 2010 Winter Olympics events.

            

            Outside of the ski season, the lifts take bikers up the mountains and they double as bike park with some spectacular tracks.
            At the foot of the mountain, in Whistler Village, you can admire the jumps some of the bikers are able to pull off.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So I decided to rent a mountain bike, but I didn't have the guts nor the skills to go up the mountain.
            Instead, I decided to cycle the 40 km (25 mi) long Valley Trail that runs along all of the picturesque nature in the area.
            Along the Green Lake, Alta Lake and all those other lakes, rivers, creeks, meadows, parks and forests in between the mountains.
            And those white-capped mountain peaks provide an amazing backdrop wherever you look: I had no camera gear with me on the bike, but the pictures I took with my cell phone still came out stunning.
            You just can't go wrong with scenery that nice, and you'll want to stop and wonder at every turn - or have a picnic.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Back in the pedestrian-only Whistler (or Blackcomb) Village, there really isn't much to do.
            Sure, there are a few shops, restaurants and bars with a good atmosphere is. And this is where the hotels are.
            But you're really only here to rest in between your activities, or to take the gondola up the mountains.
            Once you're up there, you'll find another gondola that can take you directly to the other mountain: the PEAK 2 PEAK gondola.
            If you do decide to take it (and it's not cheap), make sure to wait for the glass bottom cabin to get the best possible view.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            As long as you have an appreciation for nature, you'll enjoy the Whistler area.
            Even if you're not a skier, snowboarder or biker: you can also go ice skating in the winter, or go for a swim in one of the many lakes in the summer (and a water park is in the works.)
            And did you know that Whistler has 4 golf clubs.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Whistler region is also perfect for hikes, but I decided to go hike in the Garibaldi Provincial Park.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Lake Garibaldi&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Most of the area in between Whistler &amp;amp; Vancouver is part of the Garibaldi Provincial Park.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I really wanted to go check out the largest lake in the park: Lake Garibaldi, surrounded by mountains and volcanoes.
            I had done some research beforehand, and had fallen in love with the pictures of this lake's clear turquoise water.
            I had to see this with my own two eyes so I picked the 18 km (11 mi) long hike from the Rubble Creek parking lot to Lake Garibaldi and back.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;I really wanted to hike up to Black Tusk, (a stratovolcano) for the best view over Lake Garibaldi, but at 28 km (17 mi) and 1750m (5 740 ft) elevation gain that one would've been too long - I found all sorts of discouraging reports about doing this in 1 day.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The hike was perfect. It's not too short, but it's laid out perfectly.
            The hardest part came first, with the 6 first kilometers (3.7 mi) being the steepest.
            After that, it starts to flatten out until you reach the lake after 3 more kilometers (1.8 mi.)
            Going back, it's all downhill, and thank god it was.
            I'm sure I set a record speed those last few kilometers: the thing I was most happy to see this entire hike was at right on the parking lot - the toilet!
            I had to go so bad that I almost ran down.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Even though my running shoes were useful when I had to run that last part, I wish I had worn hiking shoes instead.
            The lower 6 km were fine, but that last stretch was covered in snow still.
            It was melting, unstable and slippery.
            And although cell reception had been spotty almost the entire hike, I had no signal whatsoever after 6 km so I was extra cautious not to fall!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I reached Lake Garibaldi, but instead of that gorgeous turquoise water, this is what I got.
            But I think it's still awesome!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vancouver, gateway to the great outdoors</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/vancouver-gateway-to-the-great-outdoors/"/>
        <updated>2016-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/vancouver-gateway-to-the-great-outdoors</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Vancouver is the gateway to outdoor activities as it is surrounded by some of Canada's best nature.
            But even if you're no great adventurer, this progressive &amp;amp; ethnically diverse city in western Canada and very close to USA's north border is worthy of a visit.

            

            We mostly stayed in the city center in the downtown peninsula, where most of the (historical) landmarks are.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Gastown, Vancouver's oldest neighborhood, is where most of the tourist are.
            There's a (fake) steam clock &amp;amp; the statue of Gassy Jack, owner of Vancouver's first saloon.
            It's charming in that it somewhat resembles old towns like you'd find all over Europe, and it's probably the best place to find souvenirs and a lot of amazing restaurants
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Speaking of restaurants: if you're into Asian food, Vancouver's got something in store for you!
            I'm the guy who used to not be too keen on trying out dishes with ingredients I had never even heard of, so I've never been too fond of Asian cuisine.
            But my group seemed to love it and we went for Himalayan, Thai, Malaysian, Chinese and Indian food.
            To my surprise, I discovered I liked about half of it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I had also never really tried sushi before.
            Well, I had tried it once - I had promised myself to try out sushi on an earlier trip, but never got around to it.
            On my way back home, I ended up buying sushi from a gas station and it was horrible (&lt;i&gt;what a surprise, right?)&lt;/i&gt;
            Anyway, we also had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alphasushibar.com&quot;&gt;sushi in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; and it was sublime: I had never before had salmon this good.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Other noteworthy Vancouver areas include Canada Place, whose white sails almost make it look like Sydney's Opera House, and the nearby Olympic Cauldron.
            Robson Street and the CF Pacific Centre malls are great for shopping.
            And for a nice aerial view, you can go to one of the 2 revolving restaurants: Cloud 9 in the Empire Landmark Hotel, or the Top Of Vancouver Revolving Restaurant.
            And Stanley Park, at the tip of the downtown peninsula, is always worth a visit if you want to walk or bike the trails or lay on one of the beaches.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2016-05-23-vancouver-gassy-jack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gassy Jack&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-05-29-vancouver-art-gallery.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Vancouver Art Gallery&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But if it's nature you're after, the North Shore Mountains are where you've got to be!
            So we took the ferry north, across the Burrard Inlet for a day tour to 2 of North Vancouver's biggest attractions.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Capilano Suspension Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            70 m (230 ft) above the Capilano River hangs a 137 m (450 ft) long suspension bridge.
            It was constructed over 100 years ago, but it has since been rebuilt and turned into a park, with totem poles and other activities like the Treetops Adventuren and the Cliffwalk.
            The Treetops Adventure is a series of seven smaller suspension bridges in between viewing platforms on 8 250 year old Douglas-fir trees.
            The Cliffwalk is a suspended walkway that'll take you around the granite cliff above Capilano River.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2016-05-25-vancouver-capilano-suspension-bridge.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Capilano Suspension Bridge&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2016-05-25-vancouver-capilano-suspension-bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Capilano Suspension Bridge&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Grouse Mountain&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The North Shore Mountains are a popular area for snow sports.
            While Cypress Mountain was the decor for some of the 2010 Winter Olympics, Grouse Mountain is the most popular ski resort.
            But by the end of May, the ski season was over.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But this is prime time for hiking, and some of us decided to hike up the mountain on the Grouse Grind.
            The hike is just under 3 km (1.8 mi), but with a 1 000 m (3 280 ft) elevation gain, you know it's going to be challenging!
            The Grouse Grind is a very steep hike and I was not in shape!
            It took me about 1:15h to reach the top, and I had to stop for a quick rest a few times in order to catch my breath.
            I know it can be done faster since a few people passed me on the way up, but I later found out that the all time record is 0:23h.
            Even that day, a bunch of people were coming in at a mere 30-40 minutes.
            I know I could easily knock off a few minutes from my own time if I were to do it again in better shape, but that is just insane!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            After getting a well-deserved drink in the Grouse Mountain Chalet, we strolled around Grouse Mountain for a bit and visited the wildlife refuge, where the grizzly bears refused to reveal themselves to me.
            Going downhill is not allowed on the Grouse Grind (and I didn't really feel like wrecking my knees anyway) so we took the Skyride gondola down.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dublin: home of the Irish pub</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/dublin-home-of-the-irish-pub/"/>
        <updated>2015-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/dublin-home-of-the-irish-pub</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            The most convenient way to get into Ireland is probably by plane.
            The Dublin airport is home to 2 of Europe's biggest low-cost carriers (Aer Lingus and Ryanair) and it even has U.S. pre-clearance facilities, so you can clear customs ahead of your flight, for those going back to the U.S.
            It's easy to reach the city center from the airport by bus or with one of the express services.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I was in Dublin for a conference, so barely had the time to visit the city.
            I'm usually pretty good at making the most of my available time in order to visit as much of the city as possible.
            In Dublin, however, I ended up spending most of my spare time in alcohol-related activities, and I don't even feel bad about it: this is the home of the Irish pub after all!
            I did visit a &lt;q&gt;museum&lt;/q&gt; &lt;i&gt;(yes, let's call it that)&lt;/i&gt;: the Guinness Storehouse, 6 floors of history about Guinness and the brewing process, and a seventh floor where you can enjoy that complimentary Guinness.
            I'm partial to my Belgian beers, but you sure get some great views over Dublin along with that Guinness!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Since I wouldn't have much time to spend, I had not done any research ahead of time.
            If I had, I'm sure I also would've known about and visited the Old Jameson Distillery - for those who favor whiskey over beer.
            Unfortunately, I only found out about it on my last day, when I was on a Hop On Hop Off bus tour and the tour guide started singing &lt;q&gt;The Wild Rover&lt;/q&gt; as we drove past the distillery.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Thanks to that tour, I've at least seen some of Dublin's attractions from afar.
            I've seen the Dublin Castle, the Christ Church Cathedral, Trinity College, and the Spire and the many other statues on O'Connell Street.
            But I can not honestly claim to have &lt;q&gt;seen&lt;/q&gt; Dublin.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I do feel like I have &lt;q&gt;experienced&lt;/q&gt; Dublin, though!
            I've always had a thing for Irish pubs, so I felt right at home in the Temple Bar area, Dublin's cultural &amp;amp; nightlife center.
            It's one pub after the other in these narrow cobblestone streets, but it's pretty touristy and it definitely gets crowded.
            If that turns you off, rest assured that there is no shortage of pubs all around Dublin, and I've enjoyed every single beer in the one's I've been to!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to get the most out of Lisbon</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-lisbon/"/>
        <updated>2015-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-lisbon</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row no-margin&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Because of its rich culture and scenic and diverse landscape, Portugal had been on my bucket list for awhile now.
        And Lisbon keeps being cited as one of the world's coolest cities.
        And that weather!
        So&amp;hellip; guess where we just went?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    

    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;i&gt;
            First off: as in any large city, watch out for pickpockets!
            I had to relearn this the hard way after getting my camera stolen on a beach in Estoril.
            I also had to relearn the value of backups, as I was left with mostly only the quick snaps on my phone&amp;hellip;
        &lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-3 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-08-04-lisbon-bairro-alto.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Torre de Belém&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-08-04-lisbon-bairro-alto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Torre de Belém&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Even though it has a lot of tourist attractions, Lisbon doesn't really have a signature landmark that sets it apart from other capitals.
        The Belém Tower is possibly the most recognizable Lisbon landmark, but it doesn't have the grandeur of the Eiffel Tower, the Big Ben or the Colosseum.
        What really sets Lisbon apart is its atmosphere:
        the colorful houses along those picturesque narrow, steep cobblestone streets full of graffiti,
        the laid-back culture - not to say that they're lazy, it just takes the city some time to truly come alive - and the busy nightlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        But Lisbon definitely has its fair share of tourist attractions.
        Belém has its tower and the Jerónimos Monastery (both &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/263&quot;&gt;UNESCO world heritage sites&lt;/a&gt;), the Monument to the Discoverers and a handful museums.
        On the other side of the Tagus is the Cristo Rei statue (inspired by the Cristo Redentor statue in Rio), but you'll have to cross the Ponte 25 de Abril bridge (which will remind you a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;'s Golden Gate Bridge.)
        And we're not even in Lisbon yet!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Lisbon was built on 7 hills at the mouth of the river Tagus and has origins that predate even the Romans.
        The Celts, Phoenicians, Romans, Berbers and the Portuguese as we currently know them have all inhabited Lisbon at some point in time, and they all have somehow influenced the city.
        It was also the starting point for many of the Portuguese expeditions.
        All of this combined has turned Lisbon into a diverse city with a lot of history &amp;amp; culture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        You don't necessarily have to try to visit all of Lisbon's attractions.
        Just stroll around the different neighborhoods without a plan. Go with the Flow and let the city surprise you.
        But if you're like me and you want to see it all, get aboard that very modern metro and head to the historic center of Lisbon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    

    &lt;p&gt;
        Let's start at the Praça do Comércio, a large square facing the Tagus river with a statue of King José I at its center - an excellent meeting point.
        &lt;i&gt;(We kept coming back to this square because the pizza in one of these restaurants was magnificent.)&lt;/i&gt;
        Go north, under the arch, and get your postcards in the pedestrian Augusta Street.
        The neighborhood we're currently in is Baixa, and it is by far the easiest to navigate: after the an earthquake in 1755, it had to be rebuilt almost entire and it's now a simple street grid.
        On your left (west) will be Chiado and Bairro Alto and Alfama is on the other side (east.)
        Keep going north along Augusta Street and until you reach another square: Praça do Rossio, where you'll find the Column of Pedro IV in the middle.
        Even more so than the Praça do Comércio, this is a meeting place for the people of Lisbon and the Rossio Train Station is on the north-east side of the square.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        This area is also chock-full of restaurants, but they're not necessarily the best: we've randomly tried out a few places, but all of them turned out to be the same generic overpriced tourist food.
        I'm sure there are great restaurants around here, but we had a much better time finding great food in the other neighborhoods, especially around Bairro Alto.
        Given that half of Portugal's border is along the Atlantic, it should come as no surprise that seafood is pretty popular; especially the bacalhau (dried cod.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Rossio Square is at the north end of Baixa.
        If you want to do some shopping, head further north on the Avenida da Liberdade to find all of your favorite luxurious brands along this wide avenue that goes slightly uphill for about 1.5 km (1 mi), up to the Praça de Marques de Pombal (Marquis of Pombal Square) and the Parque Eduardo VII (Eduardo VII Park), from where you'll be able to enjoy a wonderful view of the city.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        If, however, you were looking for more culture, you had best gone west to Chiado and Bairro Alto, or east to Alfama.
        Bairro Alto can easily be reached via the Santa Justa elevator (with wonderful views of the Baixa street grid) that is in one of Augusta Street's side streets.
        Unfortunately, there's no elevator up to Alfama, but you can hop on one of those trademark yellow trams if you don't want to climb that hills yourself.
        At the top of the Alfama is the Castelo de São Jorge (St. George's Castle.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Sintra&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Not too far from Lisbon - 28 km (17 mi) and easily reached by train - lies Sintra, a small town with 2 absolutely spectacular highlights: the Castelo dos Mouros (Moorish Castle) and the Palácio Nacional da Pena (Pena National Palace)
        The palace looks like it's ran away from a fairytale: it's a colorful combination of many different styles and it sits atop a hill, overlooking the ruins of the Moorish Castle.
        It's a pretty long walk up to the Pena National Palace, but there's a constant coming and going of carts that will take you there for a small fee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teotihuacán, City of the Gods</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/teotihuacan-city-of-the-gods/"/>
        <updated>2015-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/teotihuacan-city-of-the-gods</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I came to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/whats-left-of-the-aztecs-in-mexico-city/&quot;&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; hoping to find what's left over of the ancient civilizations that used to roam these places, but modern civilization has mostly taken over by now.
            It wasn't until I visited Teotihuacán, an archaeological site just outside of Mexico City, that I was truly awed!

            

            Little is known about what civilization were the founders of Teotihuacán around 100BC, and why it collapsed somewhere between the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.
            What we do know is that it was of major political &amp;amp; religious importance and a center of industry, and it was once the largest city in the Americas, with an estimated population of 150,000 at its peak.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Nowadays, Teotihuacán is one of Mexico's most popular archaeological sites where its 3 large pyramids steal the show.
            It's popular and relatively crowded, but the site is large enough that it doesn't get annoying.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Pirámide de la Luna&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4 pull-right&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-plaza-de-la-luna.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Plaza de la Luna, as seen from the Pirámide de la Luna&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-plaza-de-la-luna.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plaza de la Luna, as seen from the Pirámide de la Luna&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;

            Plaza de la Luna and Pirámide del Sol (as seen from the Pirámide de la Luna)
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            At the north end of the site is the Pyramid of the Moon, Teotihuacán's second largest pyramid.
            It was dedicated to The Great Goddess of Teotihuacán: the primary deity, the goddess of water, fertility, the earth and creation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            On the south side of the pyramid is a platform where ceremonies for the Great Goddess were conducted.
            At the bottom of the platform is the Plaza de la Luna with a central alter where they were conducting excavations when I was there.

            South of the Plaza starts the Avenue of the Dead, the city's central avenue flanked by countless other platforms and temples.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Pirámide del Sol&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4 pull-right&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-piramide-del-sol.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Pirámide del Sol, as seen from the Ciudadela&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-piramide-del-sol.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pirámide del Sol, as seen from the Ciudadela&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;

            Pirámide del Sol (as seen from the Ciudadela)
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Pyramid of the Sun: the largest building in Teotihuacán and the third largest pyramid in the world in ancient times, only to be outdone by the Great Pyramid of Giza (twice as high) and the 90 km (55 mi) away Great Pyramid of Cholula (which is not as high, but is bigger in volume due to it's much larger base.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So how big are we talking here?
            The pyramid has a base of 222m (728 ft) on each side and is over 70 m (&gt;230 ft) high, making for a staircase of 248 steps rather big steps before you reach the top.
            Yes you can climb it! Some of the steps are pretty big, though, so if you're not in perfect shape, you can rest on one of the &lt;q&gt;tableros&lt;/q&gt;, the horizontal bits in between the slopes.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It is unknown what deity this pyramid is associated with.
        &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Templo de Quetzalcóatl&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4 pull-right&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-templo-de-quetzalcoatl.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Templo de Quetzalcóatl&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-07-20-teotihuacan-templo-de-quetzalcoatl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Templo de Quetzalcóatl&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;

            Templo de Quetzalcóatl close-up
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            At the southern end of the Avenue of the Dead is the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (the temple is covered with feathered serpent heads) and the Ciudadela, a massive courtyard surrounding the temple.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Remains of several hundreds of humans, probably captured enemies that have been sacrificed, have been found buried beneath the temple.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's left of the Aztecs in Mexico City?</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/whats-left-of-the-aztecs-in-mexico-city/"/>
        <updated>2015-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/whats-left-of-the-aztecs-in-mexico-city</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I've seen too much of the western world and wanted to experience another culture, so I was really excited to go to Mexico City and learn all about the Mayans and Aztecs.
            Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital, lies buried underneath modern-day Mexico City and you can still find remains, like the ruins of Tenochtitlán's main temple complex: the Templo Mayor.

            

            Admission to the on-site museum is included in the site's admission fee and you can learn all about Tenochtitlán, the Aztec empire and the Templo Mayor, which is actually seven pyramids in one.
            The temple was first built on the exact spot where, according to legend, the Aztec people witnessed an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its beak - the sign of the promised land and now the emblem on the Mexican flag.
            Work on the temple began soon after the Aztecs founded the city, but - as was common back then - every emperor sought to expand the temple, using the existing temple as base.
            Templo Mayor grew into 7 layers this way, until Cortés and his Spanish army invaded Tenochtitlán and brought about the fall of the Aztec empire.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            The general area around Templo Mayor, the Centro Histórico, is the oldest part of Mexico City.
            Just around the corner of the Templo Mayor, at the center of this neighborhood, is Zócalo, the largest plaza in Latin America, with La Catedral and the Palacio Nacional on the north and east end of the square.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Although they are all over Mexico City, this area is probably the most dense in terms of tourists and tourist attractions.
            Between Zócalo and our hotel, a short 1.5 km (1 mi) walk west, we'd pass:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Avenida Francisco I. Madero, a crowded pedestrian-only street lined with shops&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Casa de los Azulejos (The House of Tiles), a peculiar house covered in white and blue tiles&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Torre Latinoamericana, once the tallest building in Latin America&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a cultural center with a stunning exterior&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Alameda Central Park, the oldest park of the city and frequently the center of public events&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Hemiciclo A Benito Juárez, a monument for former Mexican president Benito Juárez&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Not bad for a 20 minute walk!
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-17-mexico-city-alameda.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Alameda Central park&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-17-mexico-city-museo-nacional-de-la-revolucion.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Museo Nacional de la Revolución&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A few minutes to the west of our hotel - the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/mx/hilton-mexico-city-reforma.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Hilton Mexico City Reforma&lt;/a&gt; right next to Alameda Central - is the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City's equivalent of the Champs-Élysées.
            It runs south to Chapultepec Castle and it houses some of Mexico City's tallest buildings - like the Torre Mayor - and a lot of shops, restaurants and hotels.
            And there's no shortage of monuments along the street, with El Ángel de la Independencia probably being the most important landmark.
            South of the Paseo the la Reforma is the Zona Rosa, Mexico City's primary shopping and nightlife district.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-07-21-mexico-city-xochimilco.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Xochimilco&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-07-21-mexico-city-xochimilco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Xochimilco&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            For the most part, Mexico City is a big city just like any other, even though it sits at an altitude of 2 240 m (7 350 ft), making it one of the highest major cities in the world.
            Due to the altitude, you may find yourself short on breath.
            Mexico City was also know for its air pollution, so that doesn't really help, but that has drastically improved in the last few decades.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But while there is no shortage of things to do and see in Mexico City, I had to venture away from the city center, to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/teotihuacan-city-of-the-gods/&quot;&gt;Teotihuacán&lt;/a&gt; or Xochimilco, to get what I really came for: life as it was in times long lost.
            You couldn't tell nowadays, but back when the Aztecs arrived, the city was a swamp.
            Xochimilco, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/412&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, is all that is left of the lake that Mexico City was founded on, and you can ride the many Aztec irrigation canals in this Mexican Venice in one of the many &lt;q&gt;trajineras&lt;/q&gt; (gondola-like boats.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Xochimilco is easy to reach by metro/train, but you'll be on it for a good while.
            As in all major cities, you'll want to keep your belongings in sight, but by and large, public transportation is safe.
            But that is true for most of Mexico City. While it may not have the best reputation, I never felt unsafe there.
            Then again, there was a massive show of force with thousands of soldiers and policemen patrolling Mexico City.
            This probably had something to do with the escape of El Chapo a week earlier.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Back in the center of the city, there was only one more thing that I really wanted to experience: Lucha Libre, Mexico's masked wrestling.
            It was a blast!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wine and dine in Lyon</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/wine-and-dine-in-lyon/"/>
        <updated>2015-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/wine-and-dine-in-lyon</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I've often been to the south of France - from the Ardèche region to the Alps to
            the &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/côte-d-azur/&quot;&gt;French Riviera&lt;/a&gt; - and I knew
            Lyon mostly from the traffic jams on the Autoroute du Soleil - France's
            north-south artery between Paris and Lyon - on
            &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_(France)&quot;&gt;Black Saturday&lt;/a&gt;,
            when everyone's trying to get to the south.

            But Lyon has more to offer than those traffic jams, especially if you're into
            gastronomy (which, admittedly, I am not.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I used to be a very picky eater and have always been very hesitant to try out
            food I didn't know but the more I travel, the more I find myself curious about
            the local cuisine and willing to try out something new.

            Everyone knows France is the gourmet capital of the world. And Lyon is the
            culinary epicenter of France, so what better place to go for a culinary getaway?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Part of Lyon's appeal is its location in between several wine regions: Bourgogne
            (Burgundy), Beaujolais &amp;amp; Côtes du Rhône (Rhône Valley) are all a measly 1h drive
            away, or less.

            If you have some time to spare, you really should go out on a tour along the
            nearby vineyards and sample some wine at the many chateaux and wineries.
            If not, you'll have plenty of opportunities to taste the wines in Lyon's many
            restaurants and bouchons (traditional Lyonnaise eateries.)

            Just don't try their andouillettes if you're a picky eater like I am: it's a
            pork sausage with intestines and seasoning. I guess it's an acquired taste (and
            smell) that me and my company weren't quite prepared for.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2015-05-28-lyon-basilique.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Fourvière basilica&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2015-05-28-lyon-basilique.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fourvière basilica&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But Lyon's not only about food. Granted it's not France's tourist hotspot, but
            there's plenty to do. It is one of France's largest cities, only bested by
            Paris (by a large margin) and Marseille in terms of population.
            But you'll want to be in Lyon and not in Écully (west of
            Lyon, where there's nothing to do) like we were for the first few days.
            Luckily, Lyon's subway network extended to where we were and it only took us a
            good 15 minutes to reach Place Bellecour, at the heart of Lyon. And although there's
            &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Plan_metro_tram_chemin.svg&quot;&gt;good subway coverage&lt;/a&gt;,
            you won't need it too often: Lyon's city center is not too big an doable on foot.

            Place Bellecour, so I was told, is the largest square in Europe and it's right
            in the center of Presqu'île, the area just north of where the Rhône &amp;amp; Saône
            rivers meet, and where most of the action in Lyon is.
            Place Bellecour is not a terribly exciting square, but walk in either direction
            (especially north towards the City Hall &amp;amp; Place des Terreaux) and you'll find
            shops, bars &amp;amp; restaurants all over the place.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Other interesting areas in Lyon are Vieux Lyon and Fourvière, west of the Saone,
            and the wonderful Parc de la Tête d'Or east of the Rhône.

            Vieux Lyon is the old town with those characteristic narrow cobblestone streets
            that date back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It's packed with tourists,
            terraces and gift shops.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            From Vieux Lyon, you can take the cable car up to Fourvière, where the basilica
            stands proud and where you'll find the best panoramic view of Lyon right next to
            the basilica.

            But the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière is something special: it's actually
            2 churches built on top of one another. The richly decorated upper sanctuary is
            the most impressive, while the lower church is much more humble.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Not far from the basilica are two Roman theatres - in excellent condition and
            still in use for the annual &lt;q&gt;Nuits de Fourvière&lt;/q&gt; festival - and a
            Gallo-Roman museum.

            On the other side of the basilica is a replica of the Eiffel tower. While
            it seems impressive when seen from the center of Lyon, once you're up on
            Fourvière, it'll disappoint: it's only 86 m (282 ft) high and closed to the public.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            While it's not as impressive as &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, not as famous as Los Angeles, etc., I would recommend it over any other US city I've been to so far!
            It is unique in many ways, it has a monotonous good weather you can rely on, a ton of those charming Victorian houses and a long list of attractions, from the Golden Gate Bridge to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/behind-bars-in-alcatraz/&quot;&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt;.

            

            But above all it's a vibrant and diverse city and I would move there in a heartbeat, if only that didn't also mean leaving my loved ones behind.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            This is an recollection of how I've experienced San Francisco so far, an account of a frequent visitor who's fallen in love with the city.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;San Francisco's climate&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            As I said before, San Francisco has a very monotonous climate.
            Temperatures range between 10-20&amp;deg;C (50-70&amp;deg;F) all year.
            Rain is almost non-existent for most of the year except for winter, when you could expect about 10 rainy days a month.
            But even then I'd hesitate to call it rain: drizzle more accurately describes it.
            This basically means that San Francisco has a very mild winter and a dry but not crazy warm summer.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            You might expect San Francisco to be very warm because of the amount of sunshine it gets, and because that's what you could reasonably expect from anything in California.
            I made that mistake! But I soon learnt to &lt;strong&gt;dress in layers&lt;/strong&gt;.
            You can probably get by wearing only a T-shirt for most of the day, but you'll need that jacket in mornings and evenings as it cools of rapidly (which also means that late night BBQ will be rather chilly.)
            And San Francisco is a hilly city where you may experience differences in weather in between those hills.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And then there's the omnipresent fog the western half of the city is often covered in.
            The fog is so frequent that it's affectionately being called &lt;q&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog&quot;&gt;Karl the Fog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/q&gt; now (since someone started tweeting by that name a few years ago) and the most stereotypical San Francisco photograph is the Golden Gate Bridge covered in fog.
            The eastern half of the city is usually fog-free because of the hills in the center of the city.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;The people&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            San Francisco is where the hippie movement started in the 1960s, but nowadays it's what a lot of hipsters call home.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Measuring only 11x11 km (7x7 mi), San Francisco is a small city.
            But it's pretty dense in population - only to be outdone by New York City - and it would probably be even worse if it were not for its very strict zoning regulations banning high rise and obstructing new housing developments in most areas.
            Now combine that with the recent influx of relatively well-off people in the tech industry (Google, Apple, Facebook, et al. have their headquarters in or near San Francisco) and you get a housing crisis with exorbitant house &amp;amp; rent prices.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So a lot of San Franciscans are in the tech industry.
            You'll have a hard time going to Starbucks &lt;i&gt;(or another coffee shop - everyone has an opinion on coffee in San Francisco)&lt;/i&gt; without overhearing people pitching their new app that's going to change the world.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Unfortunately, the homeless are equally prevalent.
            I suspect the mild winters play their part, but I'm sure there are other, more tragic reasons why there are so many homeless people.
            They will usually hang out in the doorway of shops or in public transport stations, which also means you may be greeted to the smell of urine or feces as you get off the BART.
            You should not be worried about them, though: they may beg for a dollar, but they're harmless and won't harass you, whether you decide to give them something or not.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            About a century ago, San Francisco was made up mostly of people from Caucasian descent.
            Nowadays, they make up about 42% of the population, with another 33% of Asian descent (it's pretty close to the Asian continent after all.)
            The remaining 25% is mostly made up of Hispanics and African Americans.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Where to go&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Well, what do you want to do?
            San Francisco's main tourist hubs are Fisherman's Wharf &amp;amp; the Embarcadero on the north-east coast, and the general area around Union Square, San Francisco's main shopping district.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Scenic views&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            San Francisco is stunning and because it's hilly, great views can be found all over the city.
            The #1 vista point is definitely on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, where you'll look down on the bridge with the city's skyline right behind it.
            This view can not be beat!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you want to see San Francisco from another angle, you can not go wrong with any of these parks: Bernal Heights, Corona Heights, Mission Dolores Park or the Buena Vista Park.
            But my favorite is definitely the top of the Twin Peaks, just about the highest point of San Francisco:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-11-san-francisco-twin-peaks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;San Francisco as seen from Twin Peaks&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2013-09-11-san-francisco-twin-peaks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco as seen from Twin Peaks&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Another famous spot is Alamo Square, with the lovely Painted Ladies (Victorian houses) in the foreground and a backdrop of San Francisco's skyline.
            Or take the elevator ($8 fee) to the top of Coit Tower to see the city from yet another angle.
            Just don't forget to check that it's not foggy - when I got up there, all I could see was white!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Shopping spree&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Want to upgrade your wardrobe? Head over to Union Square!
            Just about any brand or designer has a boutique on or around Union Square, there are hundreds of them.
            Macy's, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus and the Westfield shopping center are also all in this general area.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you're not necessarily after the big brands and luxury, you should try Chestnut Street, Fillmore Street or Union Street.
            Or Haight-Ashbury for your alternative inner hippie.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And if it's souvenirs you're after, Fisherman's Wharf is where you'll want to be.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h3&gt;Museums&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            There's no shortage of museums in San Francisco, they are literally scattered all around the city.
            First and foremost: the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, or &lt;q&gt;SFMOMA&lt;/q&gt;, one of the largest museums for contemporary art in the world.
            And very conveniently located in downtown San Francisco, just south of Market Street.
            If it isn't contemporary art you're interested in, then maybe the M.H. de Young fine arts museum may be what you're looking for?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And while you're in the Golden Gate Park, the California Academy of Sciences, both a museum and a research facility, is just a stone's throw away.
            The Academy is a natural history museum with a planetarium and an aquarium, and a 4-story dome with a rainforest inside.
            More science can be found in the Exploratorium - on the Embarcadero - with its interactive exhibits designed to teach you about physics and your senses.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you're after something that is typical to San Francisco, head over to the Cable Car Museum in Nob Hill, conveniently located at the cable car depot and the motors that power the cable cars!
            Or relive your childhood at Musée Mécanique and play the old coin-operated arcade machines.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            There are a lot more museums I haven't listed here - that's up to you to find out!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Parks&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            San Francisco's home to many parks, but the Golden Gate Park definitely dominates.
            It's similar to New York City's Central Park in a lot of ways, though it's slightly larger.
            The most notable attractions in the Golden Gate Park are probably the 2 museums, the Japanese Tea Garden, and the Bison paddock.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            North of the Golden Gate Park, just below the Golden Gate Bridge sits the Presidio, a former military fort that is now a sizable park with great views of the coast and home to the Walt Disney Family Museum &amp;amp; Lucasfilm's headquarters.
            In the north-west corner of the city is Lands End, with a few hiking trails and a stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge. It also contains the ruins of the Suthro Baths, once the world's largest indoor swimming pool.
            Lake Merced Park in the south-west is another big park within the city, though I regret to say I've yet to go check it out.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And there are the many other, smaller parks all over the city.
            There's always at least one within walking distance that you can go to whenever you want to unwind.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Even though this is America's food mecca, the first thing I usually look forward to is a quality bacon cheeseburger cooked to perfection (a good burger is hard to find in Belgium!)
            But that's probably not what you were looking for?
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            San Francisco has about 4.5k restaurants, 54 of which have Michelin stars.
            As you would expect, most of the restaurants are found in tourist hotspots like Fisherman's Wharf, and around Union Square and the Financial District.
            But you should definitely check out restaurants off the beaten tourist track, e.g. in Castro, the Mission, or Hayes Street.
            Trust the locals, they've been around the city and they'll know best.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Food from all over the world can be found in SF, but it seems to me that Asian food is particularly popular around here, and you can find a good restaurant anywhere in the city.
            Good Italian food requires a little more research, though: although there's no shortage of Italian restaurants, I've always had a hard time finding good pizza and pasta in the US.
            I find that North Beach consistently delivers!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Good street food - from any cuisine - can be found in one of the several hundred food trucks that roam San Francisco.
            You can try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://roaminghunger.com/food-trucks/ca/san-francisco/&quot;&gt;track them down&lt;/a&gt;, or look for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://offthegrid.com&quot;&gt;Off the Grid&lt;/a&gt; gathering.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            As for San Francisco's signature dish: that would probably have to be clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, which you can find all over Fisherman's Wharf.
            But I don't like it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;h2&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Since San Francisco is such a small city, walking is usually a pretty good option - but keep in mind that you may have to climb some decent hills!
            The city is pretty easy to navigate, although 2 different street grids intersect at Market Street downtown.
            And even though San Francisco is a pretty safe city, it goes without saying that you should always be aware of your surroundings and use common sense.
            The Tenderloin in particular - also in the downtown area, right next to Union Square - can be intimidating.
            While I've never had issues, I wouldn't recommend (female) tourists come here (alone), especially since I've had locals there warn &lt;q&gt;us white folks not to come here at night.&lt;/q&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Coming into San Francisco by plane, you can take the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) from the airport to take you downtown.
            BART is the regional train/subway system connecting most of the Bay Area, with 8 stops in San Francisco.
            Unfortunately, this network is fairly limited and all of the San Francisco stops are on the same line, 4 of which are downtown on Market Street.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If you need to travel elsewhere in the city, you'll need to either take the bus, a cable car, or one of the heritage streetcars, all of which are operated by SF Muni.
            Most of these stop frequently, so while it's always easy to find one, this also means that it's going to be pretty slow: don't be surprised if it takes an hour to get you from one side of the city to the other.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A faster, albeit more expensive, alternative is a taxi.
            Or you can opt for an Uber or Lyft, for which there is no shortage of drivers in San Francisco - this is where both of these companies's headquarters are located after all.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What happens in Vegas&hellip;</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/what-happens-in-vegas/"/>
        <updated>2014-11-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/what-happens-in-vegas</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Is Las Vegas, the biggest city in the Mojave Desert, every bit as wild as movies would have you believe?
            While I haven't exactly gone all &lt;i&gt;Hangover&lt;/i&gt;, I'm pretty sure the answer is a surrounding &lt;q&gt;yes&lt;/q&gt;.
            This is Sin City after all.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Las Vegas is the place to be for a wild bachelor party with no shortage of strip clubs to choose from.
            Regrettably, I haven't been to one. If I did, I'd probably check out Sapphire, billed as the world's biggest strip club.
            And while we're pretty much on this subject: even though prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas, it seems prevalent with flyers for escort services being handed out on every street corner.
            After ignoring/rejecting them at first, I soon found it amusing and started collecting them like they were Pokemon cards.
            I can't believe how many different girls were being &lt;q&gt;advertised&lt;/q&gt; this way: of the 30 or so flyers I was handed, not one was a duplicate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Note: I obviously didn't partake: it's illegal, I wouldn't trust it, and even then just wouldn't be interested in these services.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            But the casinos is what Vegas is all about. Where you can gamble away your hard-earned money.
            And as long as you're playing (and tipping the waitress), you'll receive free drinks - you don't even have to be in a high-stakes game.
            I guess the casinos bet on guests getting more courageous after a few drinks and start betting more.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But there's plenty of entertainment for those without loose morals.
            The casino-hotel resorts on The Strip are enormous entertainment machines with numerous in-house bars, restaurants, night clubs, and even shopping malls.
            And they host a lot of shows. From Cirque du Soleil to musicals, comedy &amp;amp; magic shows, or your favorite popstar performing.
        &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Staying on The Strip&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We left &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on a Friday evening for a perfect weekend getaway in Las Vegas, after a long drive of about 9 hours by car.
            Since most of it was at night and through the desert, it was a pretty boring drive and I would definitely consider flying the next time.
            If you plan ahead, flights to Vegas are often relatively cheap anyway, and that's only 1:20h.
            And the airport is right next to The Strip, the center of the Las Vegas gambling &amp;amp; entertainment scene and where the giant hotel/casino resorts are located.
            But this was a spur-of-the-moment decision and we hadn't planned ahead.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Did you know that over half of the world's largest hotels are on the Las Vegas Strip?&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We parted ways upon arrival: my friends stayed at The Venetian - one of the largest and most luxurious resorts on The Strip - while I had booked a room across the street in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/treasure-island.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/a&gt;, not quite as extravagant and pricey but still very respectable.
            We were anxious to try out that &lt;strong&gt;$20 trick&lt;/strong&gt; we had heard about: when checking in, you discreetly &lt;q&gt;tip&lt;/q&gt; the front desk clerk $20 while asking if there are complimentary upgrades available.
            With a bit of luck, they'll be happy to set you up with a vacant room better than the one you had booked.
            It did not disappoint: my friends got an upgrade to a very spacious suite.
            I always like to find a vantage point where I can admire the city from above, so I had requested a room as high up as possible during my booking.
            My $20 got me a room on the top (36&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) floor! I gladly checked in to this view:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-11-08-las-vegas-night.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Las Vegas Strip by night&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Downtown Las Vegas&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Almost all casinos in downtown Las Vegas are located around the Fremont Street Experience, a pedestrian mall.
            Although there are a bunch of famous casinos here (like the Golden Nugget), most of them don't even come close to the mega-resorts on The Strip in terms of size &amp;amp; grandeur.
            The main attractions are the overhead light shows on the giant LED display canopy that stretches 4 blocks, the 3 stages where concerts are held, and the SlotZilla zip line where you can &lt;q&gt;fly&lt;/q&gt; the entire length of the Fremont Street Experience superman-style.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;

                The Strip
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;

                Fremont Street Experience
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;What to do?&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I've said it before and I'll say it again: these casino resorts are so huge you could easily get lost.
            Some resorts house upwards of 20 restaurants, and there is plenty of opportunity for shopping: i.e. The Venetian has over 160 shops lining its canals.
            And the neon lights on The Strip &amp;amp; the Fremont Street Experience are certainly a feast for your eyes.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A lot of the resorts on The Strip have a specific theme that sets them apart and you could spend days going from one casino to another, marvelling at the picturesque decors.
            The Venetian is an ode to Venice, complete with canals &amp;amp; gondolas throughout the resort, hand painted frescoes and a lovely copy of St. Mark's Square.
            Caesar's Palace will take you back to the Roman Empire, and Paris (with Eiffel tower) &amp;amp; New York-New York (with roller coaster) will remind you of the cities they were named after.
            Luxor is a giant pyramid &amp;amp; Excalibur a fairytale castle.
            The Bellagio has their dancing fountains show every 30 minutes, and MGM Grand has a lion habitat inside the casino.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But I felt that a weekend was the perfect amount of time for us to spend here.
            I'm sure I could keep gambling or enjoy all sorts of shows and activities on offer, but it's going to cost a pretty penny.
            Seriously: it only took about 5 minutes before the casino had won my first $100 and I was playing as conservative as I could.
            There I stood, waiting for the waitress to come back with my complimentary drink&amp;hellip;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Saint-Tropez: small town with a big name</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/saint-tropez-small-town-big-a-big-name/"/>
        <updated>2014-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/saint-tropez-small-town-big-a-big-name</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Saint-Tropez used to be a small fishing town, but since Brigitte Bardot in the 1950, it's become the playground of the jet set.
            I didn't really like it. It's a nice little town, but there's plenty others like it around here.
            
            To be fair: we don't own a yacht to show off, and we didn't go partying - 2 of the main reasons to come to Saint-Tropez.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            There's little reason to come to Saint-Tropez by car, as most of the streets are too narrow to drive through.
            Coming from pretty much every major town in the area, you'll reach Sainte-Maxime faster, from where you can take the ferry to Saint-Tropez.
            We were lucky to be in Sainte-Maxime on a Thursday morning, for the farmers market.
            The ferry will bring you to the harbor, which is probably Saint-Tropez's main attraction.
            It's filled with the most expensive yachts and the quay is lined with restaurants, bars and tourist shops.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-5 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-31-saint-tropez-harbor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Saint-Tropez Harbor&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2014-07-31-saint-tropez-harbor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Saint-Tropez Harbor&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-7 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-31-saint-tropez-tour-du-portalet.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Tour du Portalet&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2014-07-31-saint-tropez-tour-du-portalet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tour du Portalet&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Head inland, into the little town, and there'll be a lot less going on.
            The village is picturesque and you can go play a game of pétanque on the Place Des Lices, but that's about it.
            Or head up to the Citadelle and enjoy the naval museum in there. Or the view from up here.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But that's about it. There's just not too much to do in Saint-Tropez.
            Granted, we didn't go to Saint-Tropez's most famous beach: Pampelonne beach.
            It's about 5 km (3 mi) from the Saint-Tropez harbor, and it's where all the night clubs are.
            We had to leave in the evening, so I've no idea what the party scene is like. I wonder if it lives up to its reputation.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Living it up in Monaco</title>

        <updated>2014-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/living-it-up-in-monaco</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pull-right col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-30-monaco-port-hercule-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Port Hercule&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2014-07-30-monaco-port-hercule-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Port Hercule&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            In a previous post, I said I'd pick &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/what-to-do-in-nice/&quot;&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; if I had to choose a place to live in the &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/côte-d-azur/&quot;&gt;French Riviera&lt;/a&gt;.
            Actually, I'd prefer Monaco even more, because that would mean I'd be wealthy beyond belief.
            Property prices are through the roof here, with the average real estate agency selling apartments anywhere in the range of 1 to 20 million euros.

            

            Way beyond anything I'd ever be able to afford!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Monaco is a sovereign state and it shares a border only with France. And the Mediterranean.
            It's very small: measuring only 2 km&amp;sup2;; (0.78 mi&amp;sup2;).
            Were it not for the Vatican, it'd be the smallest state of the world.
            Because there is no income tax, Monaco's considered a tax haven.
            I guess that'll help if you want to buy or rent something there!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But it's a pretty little state. Because it's so small, you don't need more than a day to take it all in.
            Heck, it only takes Formula 1 drivers under 1:20 to complete a lap of Monaco!
            Because of the differences in altitude, Monaco can be confusing to navigate and a demanding walk.
            Especially around the Jardin Exotique, Monaco's biggest garden filled with rare &amp;amp; diverse plants.
            I'd suggest to visit it starting at the top and going down.
            When you want to come back up later, you can just take the free public elevators.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Monte Carlo, north-east of the port, is the most populous district and it's also where you'll find the famed Monte Carlo Casino, the Opera House, and where you'll find all the high end fashion.
            If you've got money to spend, this is where you'll want to be!
            Shopping in Monaco is expensive, but the prices in restaurants were alright, not too extravagant.
            They were comparable to other places in the Riviera, which is not really &lt;q&gt;cheap&lt;/q&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-30-monaco-ville.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Monaco-Ville&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2014-07-30-monaco-ville.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monaco-Ville&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            At the bottom of the gardens is La Condamine, where you'll find the port with yachts the size of houses.
            South of the port is the old city, nicknamed &lt;q&gt;Le Rocher&lt;/q&gt; (&lt;q&gt;The Rock&lt;/q&gt;) for obvious reasons.
            This old fortress-turned-palace is where Albert II, Prince of Monaco, has his humble residence.
            Be there at noon to see the changing of the guards.
            The rest of the rock is mostly stuck in time: it's still a medieval village made up of narrow streets and houses older than anyone who still lives there.
        &lt;/p&gt;

            After our visit to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/is-there-more-to-cannes-than-the-film-festival/&quot;&gt;Cannes&lt;/a&gt;, Nice was the next stop on our &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/côte-d-azur/&quot;&gt;French Riviera&lt;/a&gt; tour.
            We only had a day to spend there, and I really wished we'd had more time.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pull-right col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-28-nice-beach-promenade-des-anglais.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Beach at Promenade des Anglais&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2014-07-28-nice-beach-promenade-des-anglais.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beach at Promenade des Anglais&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If I had to pick a city along the French Riviera to live in, Nice would be the one.
            It's a pretty big, vibrant city that has much more going on than just tourism.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Avenue Jean Médecin is the city's artery &amp;amp; main shopping street.
            It's a mostly pedestrian street - except for the tramway - running from the train station in the north to the Place Masséna - the city's main square - in the south.
            From there, it's only a short walk to the Promenade des Anglais, which runs perpendicular to &lt;q&gt;The Avenue&lt;/q&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Promenade des Anglais is where it's at for that postcard view of the Nice coastline.
            It runs along the coast for about 5 km (3 mi) and it's where the cyclists arrive at the end of the Paris-Nice cycling tour.
            And while you can go on the beach (and many do) there are better options in the area: Nice's beaches consist of stones rather than sand, making them less comfortable to walk or lay on.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;pull-right col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-07-28-nice-cap-ferrat.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Cap Ferrat peninsula, as seen from Mont Boron&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2014-07-28-nice-cap-ferrat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cap Ferrat peninsula, as seen from Mont Boron&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            East of the Promenade des Anglais &amp;amp; Place Masséna is the charming old town, full of eateries and an interesting market: the Marché aux Fleurs.
            Further east is the Mont Boron hill, where you'll find some of the best views of Nice.
            Keep going, just a little further, to overlook Cap Ferrat, a peninsula on the other side of the hill.
            Or just keep going in that same direction, along the coastline, towards &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/living-it-up-in-monaco/&quot;&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt; (about 30 minutes east of Nice): it's a very scenic route where you may also want to consider a quick stop at Èze - a small village on a mountain - for an even higher vantage point.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Is there more to Cannes than the film festival?</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/is-there-more-to-cannes-than-the-film-festival/"/>
        <updated>2014-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/is-there-more-to-cannes-than-the-film-festival</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Although it's a relatively small city (with a population of 70k), Cannes is known around the world for the Film Festival in May, when it's the place to be for actors, celebrities and everyone that matters - and their fans.
            I was there in late July and last I checked, I'm not famous nor rich.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Going some place you've never been before can be confusing as you've usually no idea where to go.
            There were no particular landmarks I was desperate to see in Cannes, so I didn't do any research this time.
            My girlfriend had been here before, so I trusted we'd be alright here.
            Turned out that was years ago and she'd been there by car.
            She had not been to the train station we arrived at and didn't know directions from there.
            We followed most of the other tourists &amp;amp; went south-east-ish, to end up at La Croisette.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            La Croisette is the boulevard where you go to see and be seen, and it's jam-packed with famous luxurious hotels &amp;amp; fashion stores.
            It's right next to the beach, which was crowded with sunbathers.
            The water was filled with people trying to cool down, which made perfect sense as it was about 40&amp;deg;C (&gt;100&amp;deg;F).
            After having looked around to buy new sunscreen (I had forgotten to pack mine), we decided to join them and work on our tan.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            After a nice old lady came down to warn me about the sun - I am quite pale, at least compared to the others on the beach - we got up and walked down La Croisette.
            She was helpful and right, but she must've had no idea how much sunscreen I had already used!
            But I can only rest for so long before I get the urge to start wandering around again.
            While La Croisette and its shops, the beach, and the surrounding area were nice and all, I was almost a bit disappointed.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Evening came around and we were about to take the train back, but we'd gotten hungry.
            So we were going to wander around a little longer to find dinner, and decided we couldn't leave before seeing the Palais des Festivals, where the Film Festival is held every year.
            Only then did we notice that there is more to the west of the train station that we had not yet seen!
            The marina, for example, where we admired some of the yachts while we had dinner.
            And a lot more beaches to the west of the marina.
            But the best &lt;q&gt;discovery&lt;/q&gt; was the charming old town, with its narrow winding streets, cosy restaurants and souvenir shops.
            We ended up not going back to the train until we had to in order to catch the last one&amp;hellip;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hiking Zürich's Üetliberg</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/hiking-zurich-uetliberg/"/>
        <updated>2014-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/hiking-zurich-uetliberg</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I hadn't really made any plans when I was in Zürich for a few days, but the hotel was in such a nice location that I couldn't not go for a quick walk.
            The best things often happen unplanned, and that was definitely the case here.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I kept going for as long as the scenery was pretty and didn't realize I was hiking up Zürich's highest mountain, the Üetliberg, at 871 m (or 2851 ft) above sea level: 463 m (1519 ft) above Zürich.
            It ended up being a pretty good hike with spectacular views abound.
            There were a few steep climbs of course - I did have to overcome a good 400 m after all - but it wasn't too hard for the most part.
            Until I got to a sign that instructed me that the path was closed due to hillslides.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-05-11-zurich-stop.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Üetliberg hillslide warning sign&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2014-05-11-zurich-stop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Üetliberg hillslide warning sign&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            When I looked at the map - I had fired up Google Maps somewhere along the way to figure out where I was, and had decided where I wanted to go: the top - I soon realized going back and taking the other route would be a significant detour.
            Plus, I didn't even know if that other path would be open. So I decided to ignore the warning and keep going: I couldn't see anything blocking the road anyway.
            And I didn't see anything for quite awhile. Until I got pretty close to the top, and this awaited me:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-05-11-zurich-hillslide.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Üetliberg hillslide&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2014-05-11-zurich-hillslide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Üetliberg hillslide&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I believe it must've been almost half an hour after seeing that original warning and there had been some heavy climbs.
            And from that first point, the detour would already have been significant.
            I really didn't want to turn around: I wanted to reach the top, and I didn't want to take that detour!
            I soldiered on, slightly terrified that the rest of that path would slip away from under my feet and come down, but it didn't!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I reached the top and decided to go all the way and climbed the look-out tower, another 30 m (98 ft) up on the observation tower.
            I'm not scared of heights, but the wind was blowing hard and it did make me slightly uncomfortable.
            But the view sure made up for that. I snapped a few pictures before it got too cold, and decided to head back.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2014-05-11-zurich-zurichsee.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Zürichsee as seen from the top of the Üetliberg&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/large/2014-05-11-zurich-zurichsee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zürichsee as seen from the top of the Üetliberg&quot; class=&quot;pano&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I didn't really feel like hiking back down that hillslide and wanted to go to downtown Zürich anyway, so I was glad to find the train terminus near the Üetliberg top.
            Choo choo!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>5 New York City highlights</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights/"/>
        <updated>2013-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/5-new-york-city-highlights</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;q&gt;The city that never sleeps&lt;/q&gt;: for a tireless traveler as me, this sounds too promising to pass up.
            After having been to &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to spend another week in New York city before heading back home.
            Might as well make the most out of having crossed the Atlantic, I guess!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But where to even begin in a city that has so much to offer?
            My list was so long and we didn't even get to finish it - and boy did I try to fit everything in!
            So here's a short list of things you must absolutely do or see, and I don't think any on this list will come as a surprise.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My top 5&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;empire-state-building&quot;&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-21-new-york-empire-state.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Downtown New York City, as seem from the Empire State Building&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-21-new-york-empire-state.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Downtown New York City, as seem from the Empire State Building&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Here's where you'll get that classic downtown New York shot. The view is stunning.
            The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esbnyc.com/buy-tickets&quot;&gt;admission fee&lt;/a&gt; is $34 for a standard adult pass, which will grant you access to the main deck on the 86&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor.
            If you want to go all the way to the top, you'll pay $54 to be taken to the 102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; floor.
            You'll be stuck behind window glass on the 102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; floor, but that ticket will also get you in to the 86&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor main deck, where you can walk outside and get a nice 360 degrees New York City panorama!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Keep those prices in mind when you want to visit the Empire State Building.
            You may be able to buy tickets elsewhere (e.g. from your hotel), though they'll probably cost more.
            But at least you won't have to wait in line to buy them, although you'll still be waiting before getting into the elevator.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Also on the 86&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor: trivia about the Empire State Building's history &amp;amp; appearance in media. And a memorabilia shop.
            And there was a man-sized pluche King Kong that scared us half to death when it started moving: we had not realized there was actually someone in there!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;
                A great alternative to the Empire State Building would be the Top of the Rock, the observation deck at the Rockefeller Center.
                While the observation deck is not as high, and the building less iconic, you do get to look at the Empire State Building from here.
                Or get a neat view of Central Park.
            &lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;central-park&quot;&gt;Central Park&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-19-new-york-central-park.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;South end of Central Park&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-19-new-york-central-park.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;South end of Central Park&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Central Park is a whopping 843 acres (about 3.5 km&amp;sup2;, or 1.3 mi&amp;sup2;) oasis of peace where you can escape the busy city, and easily one of - if not the - most famous parks in the world.
            Take a walk, jog, or ride a bike. Or go on a carriage ride.
            Or visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the small Central Park Zoo.
            Or simply enjoy the street performers, sunbathe at the Great Lawn, get a selfie at the Bethesda Fountain or eat at the Tavern on the Green.
            There's a lot you can do in the park!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            You may want to start by taking a quick look at the map instead of wandering around aimlessly - like we first did.
            After a few hours of walking, relaxing and enjoying the beautiful park, we had reached the end, or so we thought.
            Turned out we'd barely seen a third of the park, and had ventured to the side instead of the other end.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;times-square&quot;&gt;Times Square&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-21-new-york-times-square.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Bustling Times Square at night&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-21-new-york-times-square.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bustling Times Square at night&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Because our hotel was very close to Times Square, we'd usually end up here at night.
            In a city that never sleeps, you just don't go back to bed right away!
            &lt;i&gt;Especially if, like me, you went for a cheap accommodation and are wary of the hygiene in your hotel room.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Times Square is where the traditional ball drop happens on New Years Eve.
            Times Square is where the broadway musicals perform (I wish I'd been able to go see one!)
            Times Square is where all the neon lights &amp;amp; advertising displays light up the night.
            But above all, Times Square is where we'd keep coming back to at night because this is where all the tourists come, the costumed street performers try to score a buck, and where you can spend hours sitting back to enjoy the colorful parade of people.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;high-line&quot;&gt;High Line&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-21-new-york-high-line.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;New York City streets as seen from the High Line&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-21-new-york-high-line.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New York City streets as seen from the High Line&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The High Line may be the least known on this list (it is a pretty recent New York attraction) but possible the nicest gem!
            This city park used to be an old railroad that got abandoned in the 80s.
            Since completing the last phase in 2014, it is now a 2.33 km (1.45 mi) elevated, walkable stretch of green within the city.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It runs through the Meatpacking District &amp;amp; Chelsea, 2 mostly residential neighborhoods without too much high-rise.
            It'll let you wander through the streets of New York without ever having to wait for traffic lights or watching out for cars, while you enjoy the plants or rest on one of the many benches.
            And because it's elevated, you'll be treated to nice scenic views of the city &amp;amp; the Hudson River throughout the course of the park.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I wish this one didn't exist, but alas.
            After the 9/11 attacks, which destroyed the World Trade Center buildings and changed the world as we know it, New York City built a monument to remember the victims: the National September 11 Memorial &amp;amp; Museum.
            The new One World Trade Center - the tallest building on the American continent whose roof has the same height as the original twin towers - now overlooks the memorial site.
            At the former location of both WTC towers are now 2 square pools with the names of the 2 983 victims inscribed on the edges surrounding the waterfalls.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I'm not a very emotional person, but this really got to me.
            It's intense, and I can't even begin to think what it must've been like for the families of these victims.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;grand-central-station&quot;&gt;Bonus: Grand Central Station&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-21-new-york-grand-central-station.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Grand Central Terminal Main Concourse&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-21-new-york-grand-central-station.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grand Central Terminal Main Concourse&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Grand Central Terminal is one the biggest railroad station in the world, with 44 platforms and 67 tracks.
            Because of its beauty and function - symbolic for arriving in New York - the station and the Main Concourse, in Beaux-Arts style, has often been featured in popular media.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Hidden away in Grand Central, in front of the Oyster Bar (the oldest business within the station) is the whispering gallery, where you can stand at 2 diagonal arches meters away and whisper sweet little nothings into the walls.
            Because of how this gallery is constructed, your whispers will be &lt;q&gt;reflected&lt;/q&gt; by the walls &amp;amp; ceiling and carried over to the person on the other side of the gallery, where they'll be able to hear them perfectly.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;3 biggest disappointments&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            While New York and its attractions amazed me in many ways, some just didn't live up to my expectations.
            But don't let that discourage you from experiencing these - they are New York classics after all!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;statue-of-liberty&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-19-new-york-statue-of-liberty.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Statue of Liberty and the ferry that'll take you there&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-19-new-york-statue-of-liberty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Statue of Liberty and the ferry that'll take you there&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Visiting the Statue of Liberty (and Ellis Island) will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statuecruises.com/statue-liberty-and-ellis-island-tickets?bid=standard#/&quot;&gt;cost you $18.50&lt;/a&gt; (as an adult) for the ferry &amp;amp; the audio tour, although you may as well get a pedestal reserve ticket at the same price if you want to climb the statue.
            I wanted to climb the statue al the way up to the crown ($21.50), but access is very limited and I didn't manage to get such ticket. Plan ahead!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The audio tour disappointed. Then again, I could've expected that.
            Even though it's on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/307&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;, there's not too much history here, and I didn't really care too much for all the details on how this was built.
            I guess the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/behind-bars-in-alcatraz/&quot;&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt; tour I'd been on in San Francisco had given me unrealistic expectations.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            On the other hand, the view from here is downright spectacular!
            In fact, you don't even need to climb the statue: my best NYC skyline shots were taken from the ferry ride over.
            So if you're only looking for that amazing skyline view and aren't necessarily interested in climbing the statue, you could consider doing one of the many other boat tours on offer.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;charging-bull&quot;&gt;Charging Bull&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-19-new-york-charging-bull.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Rubbing the Charging Bull&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-19-new-york-charging-bull.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rubbing the Charging Bull&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Charging Bull is a bronze sculpture on Bowling Green Park, and is symbolic for Wall Street's power.
            Legend has it rubbing the bull's balls (as you'll see from the discoloration) will bring you (financial) prosperity.
            We rubbed them but we're still waiting for that winning lottery ticket!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            There's not much more to say: it's a sculpture, it's terribly crowded, and there's really nothing else to it.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;coney-island&quot;&gt;Coney Island&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-21-new-york-coney-island.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox pull-right img-responsive col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12&quot; title=&quot;Coney Island and the Brighton Beach Boardwalk&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-09-21-new-york-coney-island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coney Island and the Brighton Beach Boardwalk&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Coney Island is an amusement park at the south end of Brooklyn whose main attractions are the Cyclone - a 1927 roller coaster - and the ferris wheel.
            It 's right next to the Brighton Beach boardwalk.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It's pretty seedy (although I've heard that's part of its appeal) and the surrounding area is probably not the safest.
            Unless you're actively looking for an amusement park, you may want to skip this one if you're based in Manhattan, as it takes some time to get to.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I liked the Santa Cruz boardwalk a lot better!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Yosemite Valley is stunning</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/yosemite-valley-is-stunning/"/>
        <updated>2013-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/yosemite-valley-is-stunning</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            California's Yosemite National Park, one of the first national parks, is magical with its enormous cliffs &amp;amp; domes, waterfalls &amp; giant sequoia trees.
            As I marvel the beauty of this place, I can't help but wonder what it must've been like for the first people to arrive in the valley.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            I regret that I haven't been able to spend more time in Yosemite than I have.
            I've been twice, but both times only for one day, when I was actually in &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; but had a spare day.
            It's somewhat doable, as long as you don't mind driving for about 4 hours, then 4 more to get back - that means getting up really early!
            But the scenery along the way - once the sun gets up - is not too shabby, and just keeps getting better as you get closer to Yosemite.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            So I've only been there twice, with not too much time on my hands, and spent both of those days in Yosemite Valley, which makes up for only 1% of the total Yosemite National Park area.
            There's just so much more ground I want to cover, some day.
            But the valley is amazing!
            The reason I came back here a second time instead of exploring other parts of the park, is that I so badly wanted my girlfriend, who wasn't there on my first visit, to see it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            A picture's worth a thousand words, so just look at that Tunnel View picture up top, with El Capitan (that giant granite rock on the left) and Half Dome (center).
            Too bad you can barely spot Bridalveil Fall on the right: both of my visits were in late summer and the waterfalls had mostly dried out by then.
            I guess I'll be coming back in spring next time, to see them at their best.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            You'll also get to meet a high diversity of animals.
            Squirrels are everywhere, trying to grab whatever food you drop, and you can get pretty close to deer wandering around, almost able to pet them (but don't, they're still wild animals!)
            There's also supposed to be a good population of black bears. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to spot one, though I've been looking so hard.
            Anxious to see one, I soon began to mistake just about every tree trunk for a bear!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-14-yosemite-deer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Deer in Yosemite Valley&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-09-14-yosemite-valley.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Looking over the trees at the Yosemite Valley hills&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-09-17-yosemite-sequoia.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Huge Sequoia in Mariposa Grove&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-09-17-yosemite-sequoia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Huge Sequoia in Mariposa Grove&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Speaking about trees: Yosemite's also home to some massive sequoias, the largest known trees on the earth.
            A short drive (about an hour) from Yosemite Valley will get you to Mariposa Grove, one of the 3 groves where you'll find these sequoias - like the California Tunnel tree who was big enough to have been cut open to allow cars to pass (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/09/508919216/iconic-sequoia-tunnel-tree-brought-down-by-california-storm&quot;&gt;but has now been destroyed by a storm&lt;/a&gt;.)
            &lt;i&gt;I guess I lied and did visit a little more than just the valley - but it was in a bit of a rush.&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            If I ever get the chance to go back, I'm definitely staying longer so I get a chance to hike around more.
            I'm very keen to do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm&quot;&gt;Half Dome trail&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; hike to the top of Half Dome.
            Plan your travels, as it may be hard to reach in winter (or even early fall), when roads get snowed under and access to the park may be hard.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Something for everyone in Amsterdam</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/something-for-everyone-in-amsterdam/"/>
        <updated>2013-05-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/something-for-everyone-in-amsterdam</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            From where I live, Paris, &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/a-weekend-in-london/&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and Amsterdam are about the same distance, and I had already been to Paris &amp;amp; London a couple of times.
            As a kid even, on school trips. But I had never been to Amsterdam until recently, when I went twice, in rapid succession.
            To me, Amsterdam just never had the draw these other 2 cities had, and I don't know why.
            Perhaps it's because I think the Netherlands are mostly similar to Belgium, so there's nothing new there? We both speak Dutch after all.
            Regardless, I was wrong! While Amsterdam is not quite as big as Paris or London, it's got something to offer to everyone - except for sunbathers!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Amsterdam, the &lt;a&gt;Venice of the North&lt;/a&gt;, is known for its canals.
            There's 165 of them, good for a combined length of 100 kilometers (or 60 miles), and the Canal Ring is &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1349&quot;&gt;part of the UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;.
            Would you believe that it actually beats Venice in terms of bridges? There's more than 1200 bridges in Amsterdam, while Venice has about 400. That's 3 times as much!
            You can even see 15 of them at once, at the intersection of the Herengracht &amp;amp; Reguliersgracht.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-07-02-amsterdam-ship.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Replica of the Amsterdam, an 18th century VOC ship&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-07-02-amsterdam-ship.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Replica of the Amsterdam, an 18th century VOC ship&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    A replica of &lt;q&gt;the Amsterdam&lt;/q&gt;, an 18th-century VOC cargo ship meant to sail to the islands of Southeast Asia. It sunk after a few days.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-07-02-amsterdam-canals.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Bridges in Amsterdam's canals lined up perfectly&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-07-02-amsterdam-canals.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bridges in Amsterdam's canals lined up perfectly&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    Amsterdam is known for its canals. At the Herengracht &amp;amp; Reguliersgracht intersection, you can even see 15 of them at once.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2013-07-02-amsterdam-eye.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Amsterdam EYE Film Institute&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2013-07-02-amsterdam-eye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amsterdam EYE Film Institute&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    This stunning building, opposite to the Amsterdam train station, is the EYE cinematography museum.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But while its canals, bridges, houseboats and canal houses sure are lovely and I can definitely recommend a boat ride, there's more!
            It's perfect to go on a shopping spree: from haute couture in the P.C. Hooftstraat to the malls &amp;amp; well-knowns brands in Nieuwendijk &amp;amp; Kalverstraat, to authentic &amp;amp; vintage products in the 9 Straatjes.
            And don't forget to check out some museums, like the Anne Frank House (a commemorative museum for Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl that went into hiding during the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; World War), the Van Gogh Museum or the Rijksmuseum.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Or go out and party hard!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Perhaps even more than its canals, Amsterdam is known for its open mindset.
            It's very welcoming, and marihuana and prostitution are legal here.
            There are almost 200 coffee shops in the city, and the smell of marihuana is omnipresent.
            I actually like that smell, but it's a confusing experience to smell it just about everywhere you go.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Wallen is probably the biggest red light district in the world, with around 700 prostitutes working daily.
            And very safe too! It's actually a tourist attraction and you can - and should - come visit this at night because it's also quite beautiful thanks to the canals &amp;amp; houses.
            You may not want to bring children, though, because of the window prostitution.
            But if you're with a bunch of friends, you might want to check out a peep show.
            Or a banana show. I'll leave it up to your imagination what that's about... Yes, that's exactly what it is!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>I flew over San Francisco, by myself</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/i-flew-over-san-francisco/"/>
        <updated>2012-09-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/i-flew-over-san-francisco</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            On my trip to San Francisco, I got the chance to fly a Cessna over San Francisco &lt;strong&gt;by myself&lt;/strong&gt;.
            After about half an hour on the flight simulator, to get acquainted with some controls, we went out, inspected the plane, and I soon found myself a mile above San Francisco.
            And the Golden Gate bridge. And Alcatraz.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        
        
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Victor, the instructor, sat next to me to take care of all the hard work - like talking to the control tower and landing - but I actually took off and flew this thing myself!
            I probably wouldn't have been allowed to fly on an overcast day - I don't know how to read most of the instruments - but weather conditions were perfect.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I realize this may not be for everyone. If you're scared of flying, I'm sure this'll sound like a nightmare.
            As I said before: conditions were perfect, and I didn't have to worry about all the hard parts of flying, but still: I feel like I have a bit more of an understanding of how flying works, and all of a sudden it doesn't seem so scary anymore.
            I had 2 friend in the back of the plane. And even though I can't think of any reason they'd trust me with their life, they seemed just as excited about it as I was.
            But they had done this before, so they knew what to expect and knew it'd be fine!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            My introductory flight was with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caliairways.com/CalAir/index.php/flight-training/intro-flight&quot;&gt;California Airways&lt;/a&gt; and cost around $300.
            There are multiple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/search?start=0&amp;cflt=flightinstruction&amp;l=g:-121.92008972167969,38.00135043924089,-122.74406433105469,37.34919264529582&quot; title=&quot;Introduction flights around San Francisco&quot;&gt;other providers&lt;/a&gt; in that region if you want to shop around.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            This was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. What a thrill it was. And that view! I can't wait to do this again!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Getting sunburnt in Cyprus</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/getting-sunburnt-in-cyprus/"/>
        <updated>2012-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/getting-sunburnt-in-cyprus</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            When I think of travel, I think of adventure. Or a citytrip to soak up the local culture and hop from landmark to landmark.
            Relaxing at the beach is not what I'd usually seek out, but I did when I visited Paphos.
            And let me tell you, there was no shortage of sun &amp;amp; beaches!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            Paphos is located in the south-west of Cyprus and has a population of only slightly over 30k.
            Even though that's pretty small, it's still one of the bigger cities of Cyprus.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        

        &lt;p&gt;
            We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/cy/st-george-spa-golf-beach-resort.html?aid=1286294&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&quot;&gt;Hotel St. George Beach&lt;/a&gt;, which boasts an impressive lobby with its huge chandelier &amp;amp; cosy bar.
            This hotel has all one could wish for: the restaurant is very nice, there's an in-house spa, and lots of activities are organized for the guests &amp;amp; their children.
            It has its own amazing pool &amp;amp; pool bar, but is also right next to the beach, where there's plenty of activities to chose from: jetski, parasailing, diving, ...
            But even though the beach is lovely, I'm just not the type to spend all day there.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            So we took the bus for about half an hour to Paphos town. And the archaeological sites. And the harbour.
            And what a most charming harbour it was! Chock-full of bars, restaurants, souvenir shops, and the picturesque Paphos Fort.
            I could sit here all night. And we did. More than once! I could get used to this laid-back atmosphere.
            The restaurants around here were amazing: there's a lot of different cuisines to choose from, with great quality. Not just in the harbour, but in all of Paphos.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Paphos Town Market, on the other hand, disappointed. It's run-down and mostly just tourist souvenir shops.
            We did come back a couple of times, though, because we had discovered an abandoned litter of 5 of the cutest little kittens.
            We came back to feed them &amp;amp; play with them for awhile, as did some of the shop owners.
            One of them - a super nice lady - eventually took them to an animal shelter near the end of our vacation. I sure hope they found a good new home!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-08-09-paphos-fort.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Paphos Fort&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-08-09-paphos-mosaic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Roman mosaics in Paphos Archaeological Park&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-08-09-paphos-mosaic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roman mosaics in Paphos Archaeological Park&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-08-09-paphos-odeon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Paphos Odeon&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-08-09-paphos-odeon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paphos Odeon&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But there's more to Paphos than shops, bars &amp;amp; restaurants. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/79&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; after all, best known for the Paphos Archaeological Park.
            That Archaeological Park, near the Paphos harbour, has remains from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages, but the Roman remains are what it's all about.
            Particularly the Roman villas with their mosaic floors. Some of them are very well kept and very large.
            There's also a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century classic Greek amphitheathe - the Odeon - that is still being used for musicals and performances.
            The Tombs of the Kings date back even further, to the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century BC. While no actual kings were buried here, these tombs are still an impressive feat: carved out of solid rock and decorated with pillars.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Just don't forget to bring your sunscreen &amp;amp; apply liberally: you'll be mostly outdoors and that sun sure is burning!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Behind bars in Alcatraz</title>
        <link href="https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/behind-bars-in-alcatraz/"/>
        <updated>2012-05-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>https://www.gone-fishing.net/travels/behind-bars-in-alcatraz</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Alcatraz, nicknamed &lt;q&gt;The Rock&lt;/q&gt;, needs no introduction.
            It has a reputation, it's a place of legends.
            It's been featured in a ton of movies &amp;amp; tv series.
            Naturally, it was at the top of my list when I was in &lt;a href=&quot;/travels/understanding-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and it did not disappoint!
        &lt;/p&gt;

        
        

        &lt;p&gt;
            It's easy to see where the legends come from.
            It's had its share of famous inmates, like Al &lt;q&gt;Scarface&lt;/q&gt; Capone, &lt;q&gt;Machine Gun&lt;/q&gt; Kelly and &lt;q&gt;The Birdman&lt;/q&gt;.
            But its military history &amp;amp; the occupation by the Indians are not as widely known.
            In a nutshell:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;nr-ul&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;h6&gt;01&lt;/h6&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In the middle of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Alcatraz started out as a military garrison, meant to protect the San Francisco bay.
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;h6&gt;02&lt;/h6&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Because of rapid advancements in military technology, it soon turned into a military prison: its isolation, and the extremely cold &amp;amp; strong currents make it nearly impossible to escape.
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;h6&gt;03&lt;/h6&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In 1933, Alcatraz became the federal prison it is now mostly known for.
                    There were 14 escape attempts, or 36 different prisoners. Most of them were caught &amp;amp; some died.
                    There are 5 whose fate is unknown, and are presumed to have drown.
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;h6&gt;04&lt;/h6&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In 1963, Alcatraz prison was closed until, in 1969, the island was overtaken by Indians in protest of the treatment of native Americans.
                    The occupation ended 2 years later. In 1973, it was opened to the public.
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The Alcatraz tour is without a doubt the best tour I've ever been on, but that's hardly a surprise given its colorful history.
            Take the excellent audio tour that will guide you through the prison: from the library to the mess hall, the recreation yard &amp;amp; the control room, the ruins of the warden's house, and most importantly: the cell blocks.
            Or you can hang around the rangers who'll tell you fascinating stories.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-05-27-alcatraz-cells.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Alcatraz prison cells&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-05-27-alcatraz-cells.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alcatraz prison cells&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    Escape of the Anglin brothers &amp;amp; Morris, who'd put papier-mâché heads on their pillows.
                    You can spot the hole in the wall through which they escaped.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-05-27-alcatraz-sf-view.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;San Francisco, as seen from Alcatraz&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-05-27-alcatraz-sf-view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco, as seen from Alcatraz&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    This San Francisco skyline is what Alcatraz prisoners could see every single day.
                    Possibly even hear, with the right winds.
                    So close, yet so far away.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-4 no-padding text-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-05-27-alcatraz-control-room.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Alcatraz prison control room&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-05-27-alcatraz-control-room.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alcatraz prison control room&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;span&gt;
                    The Alcatraz control room.
                    I'm afraid they didn't have surveillance camera's yet.
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            It was rumored to be the inescapable prison, yet so close to the San Francisco coast.
            Inmates could see the city at just 2 km (1.25 mi) away.
            With the wind blowing in the right direction, they must've been able to hear the noise from the bustling city.
            I'm sure that's enough to drive one insane.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            And while there hasn't been a confirmed escape, there is some uncertainty about the escape of the Anglin brothers &amp;amp; Morris, of which you can learn all about on the tour!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Angel Island&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Angel Island is a lesser known gem in the San Francisco Bay.
            It's the much bigger island north of Alcatraz that served, among other things, as immigration station (much like Ellis Island in New York) and a military post.
            The entire island is now a state park and can be visited year-round.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;small-gallery row no-margin&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-05-27-angel-island-fort-mcdowell.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Fort McDowell&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-05-27-angel-island-fort-mcdowell.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fort McDowell&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 no-padding&quot;&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;/photos/full/2012-05-27-angel-island-battery-ledyard.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lightbox&quot; title=&quot;Battery Ledyard&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;/photos/thumb/2012-05-27-angel-island-battery-ledyard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Battery Ledyard&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            I didn't plan to visit Angel Island - I didn't even know it - but the only tour still available that day was the Alcatraz + Angel Island combo.
            And there were no afternoon tours that day to celebrate the 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the Golden Gate bridge, with the USS Iowa and USS Nimitz sailing into the bay.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Included in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/website/price-schedule-chart.aspx&quot;&gt;ferry tickets&lt;/a&gt; is a 1 hour historic tram tour around the island.
            You'll get all sorts of information about the history of the island, and stop at a few places that provide a wonderful view of the bay - with the Golden Gate &amp;amp; Bay bridge, Alcatraz, and the San Francisco skyline in the distance.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            But if you're into hiking, this is where you'll want to be.
            The island is not too large, but there are some nice trails &amp; you'll get get to stretch your legs on some semi-challenging terrain.
            The top is the island, Mt. Livermore, is at 240 m (or 788 ft), and there will be plenty of scenic overlooks along the way.
        &lt;/p&gt;
