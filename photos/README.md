3 directories

- large:
All images here will automatically show up in "Photos" page.
These images are prefixed with a date because that's the order they will show up
in the "Photos" page (alphabetical, descending)
Run all images through ImageOptim.

- small:
These are the thumbnails for all images in /large directory.
Let's say these thumbs should be no smaller than 600 high & 800 wide.
Every image in /large should have a corresponding thumb here.
Run all images through ImageOptim.

- other:
All other images I may want to use inside stores, but don't want to show up in
the "Photos" page.
Run all images through ImageOptim.
